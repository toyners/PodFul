<p>Announcer:	This episode of Astronomy Cast is brought to you by Swinburne Astronomy Online, the world&#8217;s longest running online astronomy degree program.  Visit Astronomy.SWIN.edu.au for information.</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	Astronomy Cast episode 405, Method Not Found. Welcome to Astronomy Cast, our weekly fact-based journey through the cosmos where we help you understand not only what we know but how we know what we know.  My name is Fraser Cain.  I&#8217;m the publisher of Universe Today and with me is Dr. Pamela Gay, a professor at Southern Illinois University, Edwardsville and the director of Cosmo Quest.  Hey Pamela, how you doing?</p>
<p>Pamela Gay:	I&#8217;m doing well.  How are you doing?</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	Good.  When I say the director of Cosmo Quest, that really means a lot these days.  How are things going with Cosmo Quest?</p>
<p>Pamela Gay:	I&#8217;ve become far more of a paper pusher than I ever meant to become.  I always wanted to be that person out there doing things but now I&#8217;m the person out there enabling other people to do things, which is satisfying because there&#8217;s people with jobs and stuff.  But, wow, paperwork, wow.  All of you out there who are career managers and bureaucrats, you&#8217;re doing, like, God&#8217;s work.</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	Yeah, I have a whole army that surrounds me to handle the paperwork because if I didn&#8217;t it would just pile up like snowdrifts in my house.</p>
<p>Pamela Gay:	Yeah, yeah.  So, yeah, it&#8217;s going well.  We still have a data management position open.  And the reason that it&#8217;s still open is mostly because we&#8217;ve been so busy getting subcontracts out to all of our collaborating institutions that we haven&#8217;t had a chance to look at job applicants yet.  So if you are a baby PhD looking for your first post doc, we may have one for you.</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	Right on.</p>
<p>Pamela Gay:	Yeah, CosmoQuest.org/X/open-jobs</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	That sounds great.</p>

<p>Fraser Cain:	All right.  So last week we talked about knowledge, what we do and don&#8217;t know.  And this week we talk about questions which are impossible to ask, where the answers don&#8217;t exist, where the data can&#8217;t be found.  And really, we wanted something that would line up with an obscure error code in Apache.  So we forgot to do the 404 but we got the 405 in there so I think that&#8217;s what really matters.</p>
<p>	Okay, Pamela.  So let&#8217;s move on then to our seeking knowledge to places that just – you shouldn&#8217;t even ask a question.</p>
<p>Pamela Gay:	Well, it&#8217;s not that you shouldn&#8217;t ask the question.  It&#8217;s that when you ask the question, the universe responds with method not found.  There&#8217;s just some questions that we don&#8217;t have the ability – not because of lack of technology, that was last week – but we don&#8217;t have the ability because of the nature of the universe to find the answer.</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	Okay.  So let&#8217;s go with one that I think people are familiar with.  They&#8217;ve heard it before and this is this idea of the uncertainty principle.  Because this is a great example of one where your attempt to find the answer will mess up the answer.  You&#8217;re just – you&#8217;re wrecking it.  So let&#8217;s talk a bit about how that works.</p>
<p>Pamela Gay:	So the uncertainty principle says that you can either know where something is or how fast it&#8217;s going but you can&#8217;t know both at once.  And this isn&#8217;t, again, one of those limitations on how well we can measure things.  This is a fundamental issue in the universe where the relationship between where something is and its momentum, there&#8217;s a constant in there and you just can&#8217;t have – you can&#8217;t have zero uncertainty.</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	So what happens?  Like as you&#8217;re trying to measure one, what&#8217;s happening to the other one?  So if you were in the lab – I&#8217;m sure this has been backed up in the lab in credible detail – the better you measure the momentum, what happens to the position?</p>
<p>Pamela Gay:	It&#8217;s not that something happens to the position so much as the techniques that allow you to know one with the fundamental way the universe works don&#8217;t allow you to get at the other one simultaneously.  You basically can&#8217;t get there from here.</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	And so if you measure one with incredible certainty like its position or its momentum, that other question – </p>
<p>[Crosstalk]</p>
<p>Pamela Gay:	 &#8212; becomes [inaudible] [00:05:34] – </p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	 &#8212; becomes a field of probability that you can&#8217;t address.</p>
<p>Pamela Gay:	Yeah.</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	If you switch over to the other one, the other one becomes this field of uncertainty that you can&#8217;t address.</p>
<p>Pamela Gay:	Right.</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	So what if you measure one and then you quickly move over to the other one and you measure the other one?</p>
<p>Pamela Gay:	Well, the sucker&#8217;s in motion so since it&#8217;s in motion you can go from quickly knowing one to quickly knowing the other and the uncertainty still is there.  So mathematically what we&#8217;re looking at is the uncertainty and how well we know the position multiplied by the uncertainty in how well we know the momentum is always going to be greater than some constant that happens to be H bar over two.  It&#8217;s just a number.</p>
<p>	Another way of looking at it is velocity is how a lot of people look at it but because relativistic stuff can be involved, you need to use the momentum equation because the mass is tied up in there as well.  So even though you may always hear position and velocity, it&#8217;s really position and momentum, just to get tricky with you.</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	That&#8217;s good.  Now it saved you probably a hundred letters so that&#8217;s perfect.  Centripetal, centrifugal, centripetal, centrifugal.  So, right, but I think what&#8217;s really important, right, is you mentioned this thing, it&#8217;s not your tool.  Your techniques aren&#8217;t great and your tools aren&#8217;t great and you really, really work at it and you make the most perfect laboratory with the most perfect measurements with the most perfect equipment.  There is a place you can never get past.</p>
<p>Pamela Gay:	Right.  And this has to do in part with the wave particle reality of our universe where you have to factor in the fact that even stuff is really a wavelength.  And where exactly is the center of a wavelength?  Even you and I have our own intrinsic wavelengths.  It&#8217;s just for us, as we talked about a million episodes back, the size of our wavelength is smaller than our body</p>
<p>	But when you start looking at these little tiny particles, their wavelength is not all that different from their particle size, or at least what we imply is their particle size.  And so you&#8217;re kind of stuck trying to figure out how to untangle the center of that and the velocity at which everything is traveling.  And quantum mechanics says, no.  It just says no.</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	And that&#8217;s gotta feel just, I don&#8217;t know, [inaudible] [00:08:12] – </p>
<p>Pamela Gay:	Why?  Why does this bother people?</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	 &#8212; for some people.  It bothers people.  Okay.  So, I mean, this was sort of the – and we&#8217;re gonna come back around to this, right.  We&#8217;re gonna get to the place where you go, where you as our counselor tell us there will be things that we can never know and we need to be all right with that.  But we&#8217;ll get to that as we sort of approach the end of this episode.  Let&#8217;s move to another place that we – in that sort of same category as the what&#8217;s outside the universe question.</p>
<p>Pamela Gay:	Okay.</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	What&#8217;s outside the universe?  What&#8217;s the universe expanding – and we did a whole episode about this but I think, you know, I&#8217;ve had to explain it a hundred times.  I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ve – so let&#8217;s sort of like come back around as we explain why, again, that is a kind of question that you cannot find the answer to.</p>
<p>Pamela Gay:	And here the issue is, there&#8217;s no method to see outside of our space time continuum.  And there&#8217;s no physics to say that there would be a method to see outside of our space time continuum.  As far as we know, our space time continuum is complete unto itself and it&#8217;s kinda like we live on the surface of a balloon with no hope of burrowing through the surface or jumping off of the surface.  We&#8217;re just stuck here.</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	My favorite explainer on this is called No Edge.  And it&#8217;s – oh my god, I forgot his name.  It&#8217;s from – it&#8217;s an alien from Beetlejuice on YouTube.  And the video&#8217;s called No Edge.  And he explains sort of that it&#8217;s kind of like a video game like Asteroids where you go from one side of the screen to the other side of the screen.</p>
<p>	And so if you increase the size of the screen in Asteroids, you just keep scrolling around, whether you go off the top of the screen or whether you go off the left-hand side of the screen, right.  Like, what&#8217;s outside the screen in Asteroids?  There&#8217;s nothing.  So just do one more dimension, right?</p>
<p>Pamela Gay:	Yeah.</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	So just go – imagine if you&#8217;re in Asteroids and you go towards you in the game and you pop out on the back of the screen and you keep moving back forward or go the other way, right.  And so if you expand that, you can make it bigger and you can travel further but it&#8217;s still a finite volume of space that has no outside.  You can never get there.</p>
<p>Pamela Gay:	Yeah, it&#8217;s okay.</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	Yeah, and that – </p>
<p>Pamela Gay:	I&#8217;m just gonna keep saying that a lot this episode.</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	It&#8217;s okay.  It&#8217;s all right.  We can know the solve.  And that if it is outside the universe, it&#8217;s Zod from Beetlejuice.  That&#8217;s it, Zod.  Zog, Zog, yeah.  A bunch of people to check on that.  Yeah, Zog from Beetlejuice.  It&#8217;s a great series and I highly recommend you search this up on YouTube.</p>
<p>	And then this idea, right, that if it&#8217;s outside the universe but you could measure with the laws of physics of our universe then it&#8217;s, by definition, part of the universe.</p>
<p>Pamela Gay:	And so there&#8217;s just no method to see what&#8217;s outside of our universe.</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	What about before the universe?</p>
<p>Pamela Gay:	We don&#8217;t even really have a way to see before 300,000 years ago so, yeah – no, there&#8217;s no method.  There are methods to see – </p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	You mean 300,000 years after the big bang.</p>
<p>Pamela Gay:	That&#8217;s what I meant, yes.  Wrong direction.</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	Yeah, right.  But again, right, if the laws of physics time and space were instantiated at the beginning of the universe, then to ask what came before the universe doesn&#8217;t make sense.  Okay.  This is starting to not feel okay, Pamela, so – </p>
<p>Pamela Gay:	Why?</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	Because we understand this concept of before, that we as human beings intuitively understand that for every time there is a before, how can you have a time when there was no before?</p>
<p>Pamela Gay:	Why does there need to be a time that was before?</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	Because for all the times that are there&#8217;s always been a before.</p>
<p>Pamela Gay:	So you&#8217;re assuming that time is continuous and doesn&#8217;t just stop.  But if you were a photon you&#8217;d never experience time at all.</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	But how could a something come from nothing, right?  Like how – what – why did it decide to begin then, right?</p>
<p>Pamela Gay:	It&#8217;s – and these are things that we don&#8217;t have a method to determine.  It&#8217;s just there is no method to determine that.</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	So what do you mean when you say there&#8217;s no method?</p>
<p>Pamela Gay:	So there is a way for me to get the coffee cup off of the surface of my desk.  I pick it up with my hand.  I could also pick up the whole desk.  There&#8217;s ways for us to do this.  There are ways for me to measure why I appear slightly blue if you&#8217;re watching this on YouTube and that&#8217;s called a photo multiplier of some sort that&#8217;s detecting the light flux.  I don&#8217;t have one of those or my lighting might not suck quite so badly.</p>
<p>	There are methods for us to do things, to measure things, to determine things.  There&#8217;s technology that is defined through the physics that governs our universe.  Occasionally physics comes along and says, no, you&#8217;re not allowed to understand that.  You just can&#8217;t get data on that thing.  There is no information.  And when it comes to anything before moment zero of our universe, the arrow of time that we&#8217;re dealing with according to most general ideas of how our universe functions, the time originates right then and there.</p>
<p>	Now there are a few theories out there that say that&#8217;s not when time actually originates and they can work to explain this in different ways.  [Inaudible] [00:14:06] work on this problem.  But even if we solve the arrow of time issue and time originating at zero of the universe, we still don&#8217;t have a mechanism according to modern physics to make any measurements of that time.</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	And so then all you&#8217;re doing is philosophizing and having an opinion, right.  Like when you have this argument with people, all they&#8217;re doing is having an opinion, right.</p>
<p>Pamela Gay:	Yeah.</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	Like I like chocolate ice cream best, right.</p>
<p>Pamela Gay:	Yeah.</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	My feeling is that I&#8217;m gonna live forever and I can eat as much chocolate ice cream as I want.  But just because you feel a certain way doesn&#8217;t mean the truth is different.  So – and even if you do figure out a way to go before time and they go, oh, it turns out time did exist before the universe and the universe is just a bubble in a multi verse, what came before that?  At a certain point – </p>
<p>Pamela Gay:	Can&#8217;t get there from here.</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	Can&#8217;t get there from here, right, and so at a certain point you have to come to grips that there are questions that there will never be answers to.</p>
<p>Pamela Gay:	What&#8217;s inside of an [inaudible] the ones that bothers people significantly.  And it&#8217;s not even answering any fundamental questions about life.  Like what came before the universe is kind of a fundamental, philosophical and religious question but what&#8217;s inside of a black hole is just annoying to not know.  But there are people who are deeply, deeply annoyed not to understand what&#8217;s inside of an event horizon.</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	Some of them might be in this room itself.</p>
<p>Pamela Gay:	Yes.  But it&#8217;s simply a matter that because nothing can go faster than the speed of light, another thing method not found.  There is no method to go faster than the speed of light.  We can&#8217;t send a probe in and have it bring data back out.  In fact, we can&#8217;t even look for stuff to come out of the black hole in a meaningful way that we can observe information from.  So, again, method not found.  We can&#8217;t look inside of an event horizon.</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	Maybe, right, because, I mean – well, no, I mean, I know you&#8217;re Miss Grumbly Pants but in theory with gravitational waves, we should – you know, with super accurate gravitational wave detectors we should be able to see the signal of two emerging black holes for example and try and get a sense, did they merge together really quickly, did they merge together really slowly?  Did they bounce around somehow inside?  Was there some kind of wobble inside the event horizon?  Like there might maybe be an answer to the question as opposed to some of the other stuff that we&#8217;ve talked about, right.</p>
<p>Pamela Gay:	So gravitational waves have the potential to give us some information about the time scales of mergers and other high density collisional events that are warping space and time.  But that still doesn&#8217;t tell us what&#8217;s inside of a black hole.</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	No, but it gives us another method to maybe probe.  That helps just a little bit.  And same thing with the – you talked about this a bit already which is this idea of sort of the moment where you can&#8217;t see back to the big bang.  But there&#8217;s a portion that will always be outside of our reach.</p>
<p>Pamela Gay:	And, you know, one of the things I need to corner some cosmologists on is I&#8217;ve seen some news stories where people are talking about gravitational waves allow us to see prior to the cosmic microwave background radiation.  But what gravitational waves let us see are when high mass objects interact with one another.  But there weren&#8217;t high mass objects in any theory we&#8217;ve got.  So there&#8217;s, as near as I can tell, no reason to believe there would be gravitational waves emanating from the cosmic microwave background.</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	But like with the primordial gravitational waves that they thought they had seen, this was sort of one of those possible signatures, and maybe there&#8217;s another way to get at those primordial gravitational waves.</p>
<p>Pamela Gay:	And I – we&#8217;ll have to see.</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	Yeah.</p>
<p>Pamela Gay:	Yeah, I&#8217;m a grumbly pants on this.</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	Yeah, you totally are, but that&#8217;s okay.  So I think one thing that&#8217;s kind of interesting as well is that there, sort of hilariously – well, okay, so hold on.  There are questions that we can know the answer to today that are – that people in the far, far future won&#8217;t know, right – </p>
<p>Pamela Gay:	Yes.</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	 &#8212; which is sort of like, you know, we ask is the universe finite or infinite.</p>
<p>Pamela Gay:	Yes.</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	We can never know – we might never know because if all you can do is receive signals at the speed of light, how can you know what&#8217;s outside of the radius of the universe?</p>
<p>Pamela Gay:	And if all the understanding in the universe that our civilization has and any other civilizations that are out there have, is lost then some day in the far distance future when all of the [inaudible] [00:19:37] are just islands that have nothing else within their Hubble horizon, then those peoples will have no ability to get at the idea of inflation or large scale structure any of these other things that we can observe today that will go beyond the observable horizon of those peoples of the future.</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	Yeah, so someone a trillion years from now won&#8217;t know that there was ever other galaxies.</p>
<p>Pamela Gay:	Right.  Well, they&#8217;ll know there were other galaxies.  They won&#8217;t understand that there was other galaxy clusters.</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	Or that there was a big bang.</p>
<p>Pamela Gay:	Exactly.</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	Which is crazy, right, that we happen to live at a time where this is a question that we could have answered but yet in the future.  And, I mean, I guess if we happen to live 200,000 years after the big bang happened, we could answer that question too except we couldn&#8217;t see anywhere because everything would be opaque and we would also be on fire.  But – </p>
<p>Pamela Gay:	 &#8212; and made of just hydrogen helium and trace amounts of other stuff but, yeah.</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	Yeah, then we wouldn&#8217;t be able to know.  What are some other places where we can&#8217;t know?</p>
<p>Pamela Gay:	So those are the big ones.  The other things that we struggle with is how do you detect theorized particles like the graviton?  We have no way of detecting it simply because it just defies all of our abilities to detect, which is highly annoying.  So it&#8217;s this massless thing that travels at the speed of light and doesn&#8217;t interact in any ways that we have a method to discover.</p>
<p>	So is there a graviton?  Don&#8217;t know, and may never know.  That&#8217;s another one of those things that&#8217;s just kind of annoying.  There&#8217;s also the question that you&#8217;d think would have an answer but it leaves physicists getting shouty with one another of, does gravity philosophically bend space time in a way that manifests itself in all of the ways that we think of as bending space time.  Or is that just a construct that we&#8217;ve come up with in our heads but the actual universe is just plain old [inaudible] [00:22:01] space with none of these deformations.  It&#8217;s just how the particles fly.</p>
<p>	And so there&#8217;s that philosophical, is space actually bent or is space not actually bent but this is a good mathematical construct?  I don&#8217;t know if we can answer that one either.</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	Does time go in the direction that we think it does, right, or does the whole thing run backwards?  Because mathematically if you do the time and the parody and the charge, you can run the whole universe backwards.</p>
<p>Pamela Gay:	Well, so there I think it starts to get into simply word choice, forwards backwards, that&#8217;s a word choice.  But there are other things that start to get into the same idea as the uncertainty principles.  So for instance, it&#8217;s generally thought – and there&#8217;s a few experiments that people are arguing over the interpretation of, but it&#8217;s generally thought that you can&#8217;t see a piece of light a particle or photon of light as both a wave and a particle simultaneously.</p>
<p>	So it may be that we have to treat things consistently as waves or as particles but only by doing things that may actually just be essentially physical magic that&#8217;s explainable.  You can&#8217;t actually simultaneously see the wave and particle behavior.</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	And tides go in, tides go out.  You can&#8217;t explain that.</p>
<p>Pamela Gay:	I can explain it badly just like everybody else.</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	Yeah, that was a joke.  So then one I think that really intrigues people, and we did a whole show on this, I mean, we&#8217;re intrigued too, which is this idea of the multiverse, right, that every moment we make a choice, every time a particle, a probability event happens, it could be generating entirely new multiple universes which the math works but we could never access those other universes.</p>
<p>Pamela Gay:	There&#8217;s nothing stopping there from being an infinity of other universes out there.  And we just can&#8217;t get there from here.  So I just wanna bring up, there&#8217;s the movies Dr. Strange Love that has the fabulous title of How I Learned to Stop Worrying And Love the Bomb  And I&#8217;m not gonna love the bomb but it might be that it&#8217;s okay to say how I learned to stop worrying and love what I can&#8217;t know.  And it&#8217;s all right for there to be things that we just can&#8217;t know.</p>
<p>	It&#8217;s, I think, more pleasing in some ways to have a universe that isn&#8217;t just so but instead has certain things that are just sort of, this is the thing that you can&#8217;t know yet or ever.  And take that, humans, now you get to be perplexed forever.  That&#8217;s kinda cool to me.</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	Yeah well, this is where, I think, you become our counselor, right, which is that I think for a lot of people, and I&#8217;m gonna definitely put myself in that camp, I&#8217;m comfortable to say I don&#8217;t know but I&#8217;m super not comfortable with saying, I can&#8217;t ever know.  That my hope and faith is that these questions are just a matter of not having enough computational energy, not having enough time spent on the problem, not enough Einsteins being born and figuring this stuff out.</p>
<p>	But I know in my heart that that&#8217;s wrong, that there are gonna be stuff that you have to just say, huh, that&#8217;s a mystery, and we&#8217;ll never know the answer to it.</p>
<p>Pamela Gay:	And I think this comes with the difference of being able to accept wonder or not.  Today&#8217;s apparently the day of quotes.  I brought this up last week and then I went off and actually found it.  There’s a quote by Thornton Wilder in the play Our Town and it has Emily, the lead character saying, &#8220;Oh earth, you&#8217;re too wonderful for anybody to realize you.  Do any human beings ever realize life while they live it every, every minute?&#8221;  And the stage manager responds, &#8220;No.  Well, the saints and poets, maybe they do some.&#8221;</p>
<p>	And this idea that we can&#8217;t fully understand how wonderful our universe is just with math and science and physics and thinking, that there&#8217;s some things that you just have to wonder at.  And that&#8217;s where the poetry sometimes has to capture the things that the math can&#8217;t.</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	Right.  But by your definition, that stuff doesn&#8217;t capture it either.  It just makes the not knowing feel a little more palatable, you know.  You&#8217;re still swallowing the same bitter pill but now you&#8217;re experiencing a little tingly, wonder and joy as you consider the bleak possibility is gonna be stuff that we can never know the answer to.</p>
<p>Pamela Gay:	And I think it&#8217;s okay to sometimes have universe light as watered down and poets trying to express things that math science can&#8217;t because our meager little human brains just can&#8217;t fully comprehend that it&#8217;s okay to not know.</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	Yeah, and I love to have this conversation with people and where I&#8217;ll say like, well, where do you think the whatever, right, where do you think the universe came from?  Like, I don&#8217;t know and I&#8217;m cool with that.  And if you think you do know, you&#8217;re wrong.  So you don&#8217;t know just like I don&#8217;t know and I&#8217;m okay with it and you&#8217;re not.</p>
<p>	So that&#8217;s my – but I do like to have that argument with people, right, which is just like, you know, they don&#8217;t know.  And I don&#8217;t know and nobody knows and that&#8217;s okay.  You don&#8217;t have to know.  So here we are at the end of Astronomy Cast knowing so little.</p>
<p>Pamela Gay:	And that&#8217;s okay.</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	Yep.  All right.  Thanks, Pamela.</p>

Fraser Cain:	Astronomy Cast episode 405, Method Not Found. Welcome to Astronomy Cast, our weekly fact-based journey through the cosmos where we help you understand not only what we know but how we know what we know.  My name is Fraser Cain.  I&#039;m the publisher of Universe Today and with me is Dr. Pamela Gay, a professor at Southern Illinois University, Edwardsville and the director of Cosmo Quest.  Hey Pamela, how you doing?

Pamela Gay:	I&#039;m doing well.  How are you doing?

Fraser Cain:	Good.  When I say the director of Cosmo Quest, that really means a lot these days.  How are things going with Cosmo Quest?

Pamela Gay:	I&#039;ve become far more of a paper pusher than I ever meant to become.  I always wanted to be that person out there doing things but now I&#039;m the person out there enabling other people to do things, which is satisfying because there&#039;s people with jobs and stuff.  But, wow, paperwork, wow.  All of you out there who are career managers and bureaucrats, you&#039;re doing, like, God&#039;s work.

Fraser Cain:	Yeah, I have a whole army that surrounds me to handle the paperwork because if I didn&#039;t it would just pile up like snowdrifts in my house.

Pamela Gay:	Yeah, yeah.  So, yeah, it&#039;s going well.  We still have a data management position open.  And the reason that it&#039;s still open is mostly because we&#039;ve been so busy getting subcontracts out to all of our collaborating institutions that we haven&#039;t had a chance to look at job applicants yet.  So if you are a baby PhD looking for your first post doc, we may have one for you.

Fraser Cain:	Right on.

Pamela Gay:	Yeah, CosmoQuest.org/X/open-jobs

Fraser Cain:	That sounds great.

Fraser Cain:	All right.  So last week we talked about knowledge, what we do and don&#039;t know.  And this week we talk about questions which are impossible to ask, where the answers don&#039;t exist, where the data can&#039;t be found.  And really, we wanted something that would line up with an obscure error code in Apache.  So we forgot to do the 404 but we got the 405 in there so I think that&#039;s what really matters.

	Okay, Pamela.  So let&#039;s move on then to our seeking knowledge to places that just – you shouldn&#039;t even ask a question.

Pamela Gay:	Well, it&#039;s not that you shouldn&#039;t ask the question.  It&#039;s that when you ask the question, the universe responds with method not found.  There&#039;s just some questions that we don&#039;t have the ability – not because of lack of technology, that was last week – but we don&#039;t have the ability because of the nature of the universe to find the answer.

Fraser Cain:	Okay.  So let&#039;s go with one that I think people are familiar with.  They&#039;ve heard it before and this is this idea of the uncertainty principle.</itunes:summary>

<p>Female Speaker 1:	This episode of Astronomy Cast is brought you by Swinburne Astronomy online, the world’s longest running online astronomy degree program. Visit astronomy.swin.edu.au for more information.</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	Astronomy Cast episode 404, what we know, what we don’t know, and what we can’t know.  Welcome to Astronomy Cast, our weekly facts based journey through the cosmos.  We’ll help you understand not only what we know, but how we know what we know.  We say what we know and don’t know and can’t know quite a lot.  Wow.  My name’s Fraser Cain.  I’m the publisher of Universe Today, and with me is Dr. Pamela Gay, a professor at Southern Illinois University Edwardsville and the director of Cosmo Quest.  Hey, Pamela, how you doing?</p>
<p>Dr. Pamela Gay:	I’m doing well.  How are you doing?</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	I don’t know.  I probably can’t know.  No, I know.  I’m doing good, doing good.  The weather is lovely here, and it’s that time where we come back around to spring and we notice it.</p>
<p>Dr. Pamela Gay:	It is true.  I bike rode 36 miles this weekend, lapping in as much sunlight as I could, but we were only having Indian summer.  So while my tulips are coming up, they’re going to get snowed on later this week.</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	No, we’re done with snow.  It’s going to be nice from here on out.  Okay, cool.  So let’s do this episode.</p>
<p>Female Speaker 1:	This episode of Astronomy Cast is brought to you by 8th Light Inc.  Eighth Light is an agile software development company.

<p>Fraser Cain:	There are the things that we know, the things that we don’t know, and the things that we can’t know.  So how do we know which one is which when we’re deciding to find research and direct our scientific inquiry.  This just sounded like a great quote from – I can’t believe I’m saying this – Donald Rumsfeld.  I’m trying to remember the gist of it, but it was something like there’s the unknown – there’s no known –</p>
<p>Dr. Pamela Gay:	There’s the known.</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	There are the known knowns, there are the known unknowns, there are the known – sorry – you have the known unknowns, and then there are the unknown unknowns, the ones that we don’t know that we don’t know.  And although it was used just five [inaudible] [00:02:58], it’s actually a really clever thing to categorize the world in, which is that when we direct our scientific inquiries, there’s this stuff that we already know.  We know gravity makes things fall, and we know mathematically.  </p>
<p>And then there’s the stuff that we know, but we just know that we don’t know it.  And then there’s the stuff that we don’t know that we don’t know, and then there’s a whole other class of stuff, which Rumsfeld forgot, which is that we can’t know it.  I think there’s a really good distinction that you put in.  So let’s go back to the beginning here and talk about – you queued this topic up this week.  What’s your philosophy here in approaching this?</p>
<p>Dr. Pamela Gay:	Well, we get lots and lots of questions coming in, everywhere from Twitter to Facebook, so on and so forth, and some of them are related to things that we can’t answer, in which case we answer them to report [inaudible] people at a web link.  But a lot of them –</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	Sometimes there some math.</p>
<p>Dr. Pamela Gay:	Sometimes there some math, and I have, more than once, recommended people take college courses.  But at the same time, there are a whole lot of questions we get where it’s like, “We don’t know that.”  “What do you mean we don’t know that?”  “Well, we can’t know that.”  “What do you mean we can’t know that?”  “Well, there are just some things the universe isn’t going to let us know.”  Now, other times it’s like, “We don’t know right now.  We need to build a bigger telescope.”  </p>
<p>So it seems like there’s a lot of difficulty understanding the difference between the things that we’re going to know soon, we just need a bigger hammers.  The things we just don’t know, just don’t know, could go in any direction, and then the things that people put forward that are absolutely not testable and we have absolutely no way of knowing whether or not they’re real.<br />
Fraser Cain:	So let’s come up with some example questions – the kinds of questions that we might get to which – let’s go with the, “We know it,” category.  What’s some stuff that we just know the answer to?</p>
<p>Female Speaker 1:	Well, stuff we just know the answer to is, what is the distance to Mercury?  That was something that took us a long time to figure out, but now we know it very precisely thanks to things like radar.  So that was the kind of thing that required the invention of better and better hammers – in this case, better and better optics and technology.  So we know the distance to Mercury.</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	Right.  We know how long it takes for Saturn to complete a rotation, which took a long time to figure out, and we’re not even entirely sure yet – </p>
<p>Female Speaker 1:	It has pre [inaudible] [00:05:47] bars.</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	Yeah, we’re pretty close, which is amazing that’s a question that we don’t really directly know the answer to.  But it took being able to measure the magnetic field of Saturn and calculate how long it comes around because watching the cloud churn around actually doesn’t help you get that really specific number because the thing is changing so quickly.  So that’s another thing that we now know.  </p>
<p>Dr. Pamela Gay:	And there are things like we now know that galaxies form both bottom up and top down.  They form both through the giant collapse of a giant cloud into a giant galaxy and through a whole bunch of small galaxies forming one by one and combining into bigger and bigger systems.  This was something that’s only been figured out in the past couple of years.  Even some of our early episodes we were like, “We don’t know,” and new technology, and this is only going to get better understood as James Webb space telescope comes online.  So these are all problems that just took better hammers.</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	We know that quasars are super massive black holes that are actively feeding.  We know that black holes exist, and that there’s a super massive black holes at the heart of the Milky Way.  So these are – obviously, there’s lots of stuff that’s even simpler than that.  And we now know that gravitational waves exist, although, we knew them back in the ‘70s thanks to the indirect observations of pulsars.  But we know now that we have the ability to detect them.  So those are things that we know.  And I guess there are things that we know, but we know with more and more accuracy.  So we know the age of the universe, and we’re bringing down those aerobars.</p>
<p>Dr. Pamela Gay:	The expansion rate of the universe.  When I was an undergrad, as I’ve said before, we were told, “Just use 100.  It’s good enough.  It makes the math simple.”  Now, we have it a couple of significant figures.</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	We know the size of Pluto thanks to the New Horizons space craft that did a fly by and was able to finally provide a precise measurement, as opposed to one that had pretty big aerobars.</p>
<p>Dr. Pamela Gay:	Now, these are all examples of things that people knew that we’d be able to measure once, give or take, Kepler coming along.  We didn’t know we’d be able to measure the distance to Mercury until Kepler came along.  But these are all things that, for the most part, we knew we would find the answer for one day, and finding the answer was part of the justification for building better telescopes, for building more exploratory spacecraft.  These kinds of answers are the reason that we build facilities, the reason that we have robots roving our universe for us.</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	Yeah.  It wasn’t necessarily one of its specific mission requirements was to measure the size of Pluto, but that’s one of the things that New Horizons was able to do.  And you couldn’t have gotten that level of accuracy without sending a spacecraft that close to the dwarf planet.  Okay, so those are the things that we know.  We specifically chose the stuff that has been figured out within the last decade, maybe 100 years.  So let’s talk about the things that we don’t know but can know.</p>
<p>Dr. Pamela Gay:	So we’re starting to get a better understanding of, what is the size frequency distribution of planets around other stars, which puts another way is, we’re figuring out how often we find planets of different sizes around different kinds of stars throughout our universe.  This is getting us, step by step, closer to being able to build better models of planet formation.  </p>
<p>Prior to the 1990s, we could tell you nothing about planets in other solar systems other than, maybe they’re there.  But at this point, we’re starting to build better and better technology that will get us better and better numbers that will start telling us where the other Mercuries are.  Everyone talks about finding the Earth twin.  I want to find the Mercury twin.  We’re getting there. </p>
<p>Fraser Cain:		That’s sad, but –</p>
<p>Dr. Pamela Gay:	Hey, no one shows Mercury any love.  I’m going to love the unloved planet.  </p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	Right.  So if you were to put some rules to this, like the stuff that falls into this category, it’s the stuff that either we just haven’t even discovered any of them yet so it’s still an open question on whether or not these things even exist, like intermediate mass black holes or the largest mass of the population three stars – things that are at the very –</p>
<p>Dr. Pamela Gay:	Is it testable?</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	Is it testable?  Yeah.</p>
<p>Dr. Pamela Gay:	The most straight forward way of looking at it is, is this a testable concept?  Are there intermediate black holes?  We can never prove the negative.  That’s the problem with negatives.  But we can prove the positive.  We know what they would look and smell like – well, we don’t know what they’d smell like.  We know what they would look like in outer space and how we should be able to detect them, and we just haven’t yet.  The universe is a kind of big place.  If there’s an ability to test for a thing, it’s knowable, but just not known yet.</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	Right.  Okay, so let’s go with some other examples that you think are in the – even with the capabilities that we have right now or the observatories that are coming out in the next little while.  What are some of those kinds of questions that we don’t know today that we should know – check back in ten years and we probably will know?</p>
<p>Dr. Pamela Gay:	So just in our own solar system, Planet Nine, is there life on Europa?  Is there life on Titan?  Why is there is cliff at 55 AUs in the Kuiper belt population?  All of these different things, it’s a matter of building a bigger telescope, looking in the right place, having the right timing.  There’s a chance at solving all of these.  Looking beyond our solar system, we’re going to be able to start to figure out at, what point do planets settle into their orbits?  At what point do we see wild collisions still going on?  </p>
<p>We’ll be able to get enough snap shots of solar systems at enough different points in their solar system evolution that we’ll start to understand not just the formation but the evolution, the nice model of other solar systems over time.  Looking beyond solar systems, we’ll be able to get better and better understandings of how galaxies have formed, how the metallicity distribution of galaxies has changed.  With the James Webb space telescope going on, there’s the potential to start to understand the gas and dust evolution and distribution in galaxies over time better than we can now, and this is all cool stuff – large scale structure formation in greater detail.  There’s a whole lot of filling in the details that comes with identifying the known unknowns that are testable.</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	Right.  I think the filling in the details one is great.  Is there a Planet Nine?  There might be a Planet Nine, and it may be so far away and so dim that it’s just outside of our capabilities, and it could take us hundreds or years to find it, but it is testable.  You could find the little blip moving at the right rate, and then someone else could point their telescope at it and confirm it, and you could send a spacecraft there and find it.  </p>
<p>So these are all within that capability, but there’s the stuff that – and as we said, the stuff where you’re really just narrowing down the aerobars.  We’ll send another version of WMAP up, and it’s going to plonk, and it’s going to take the age of the universe down to within tens of millions of years.  Let’s talk about that stuff that we can’t know and why.</p>
<p>Dr. Pamela Gay:	Well, and this is where we start to get into things like, what’s outside of our universe?  Are we one of many universes?  Maybe?</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	What came before The Big Bang?</p>
<p>Dr. Pamela Gay:	Yeah.  Science just doesn’t have any tests that we can answer any of these questions, and it’s when you get into these untestable ideas – string theory is currently not testable, which is why it’s one of those things that makes me grouchy.</p>
<p>Dr. Pamela Gay:	Yeah, we all know how much you hate string theory.  But it’s not like there’s no hope because there are ideas to try and say, “Well, maybe you could test what came before The Big Bang if you could somehow find some evidence, some echo of what was here before somehow permeating the universe as we see it today, and that could give you some hint or clue on what came before it.  so you can have stuff shift categories from, “We think we can’t know it,” to, “Maybe if this test turns out then that might tell us,” but most of the time it doesn’t.</p>
<p>Dr. Pamela Gay:	But the things is a lot of these things are based on the, “Well, if turns out there’s underlying theory that completely invalidates or completely changes our present understanding of the universe that is designed by genius who doesn’t yet exist.”  It’s when the shift to make something from untestable to testable requires rewriting our underlying physics that I start to get – I’m not sure that counts yet.  That’s the alternate universe; new Einstein required way of looking at things.</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	Right, but we talked a bit about string theory.  So there’s this idea that if you could – at the earliest moments of the universe, maybe the initial strings could’ve gotten their scale magnified into the comics microwave background, and maybe you could detect it in that – maybe there’s a test.</p>
<p>Dr. Pamela Gay:	And it’s when someone can define a test based on not having to rewrite the physical laws that it makes it much more rational.  When Einstein came along, he didn’t require us to rewrite Newton, he required us to expand upon it, and there’s a difference between having to rewrite the rules and expand on the existing rules.  </p>
<p>If string theory can come up with ways that match everything we currently observe and says, “Here’s how you test it,” it’s the here’s how you test it part that’s still missing with people going, “Well, let’s see if we can figure out way to get from this place where string theory’s at to this place where the cosmic microwave background is at,” and saying, “We need to define a path between these two islands.  Well, it’s hard to make a path over ocean if you don’t have a boat.</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	So what is the – we talked about some of these, and there’s a million of them – stuff that we don’t know and can’t know.  Another thing that’s kind of interesting is that the laws of physics themselves will prevent us from getting to know things.  There’s the uncertainty principle.  I actually had a conversation with Lawrence Krauss a few years ago about this, and he said that there could very well be – our physics could take us to a place where we can’t probe any further; it’s just impossible.</p>
<p>Dr. Pamela Gay:	Right, and it’s not just with the uncertainty principle.  The speed of light is a frustrating limit that you might be able to tunnel from one point to another, but one of those points probably isn’t going to be the center of a black hole.  So it’s quite possible that we’ll never actually understand, in a testably proven way, what the inside of a black hole is like.<br />
Fraser Cain:	Except with gravitational waves.</p>
<p>Dr. Pamela Gay:	Yeah, those still aren’t really going to help.</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	Right.  And then the other part is that there’s stuff – and you hinted at this.  There’s stuff that is beyond our vision.  It’s there.  If we could get there, we could test it, but we can’t get there.  The laws of physics absolutely prevent it – something that’s outside of the Hubble Sphere of us here, there’s stuff there most likely.</p>
<p>Dr. Pamela Gay:	And we may never actually know if we live in a finite or infinite universe.</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	There’s a great example.  So we may not be able to know, which is crazy.</p>
<p>Dr. Pamela Gay:	See, I find it kind of awesome. </p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	Really?</p>
<p>Dr. Pamela Gay:	You get frustrated.</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	Yeah, I want to know.</p>
<p>Dr. Pamela Gay:	And I’m like, no, it’s cool.  We study to the limits of what we can understand, and there’s so much left.  Why get frustrated when you haven’t figured all the stuff you can figure out, but there’s stuff that you can’t figure out?</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	And then I think of that last category, the one that we talked about, the Rumsfeldian unknown unknowns.  That’s where I think the source of the most interesting scientific inquiry comes from is that Isaac Asimov, “That the most interesting thing is not eureka,” but that’s funny.</p>
<p>Dr. Pamela Gay:	And this is where things like the LSST have so many people excited because this is an open-ended instrument.  There are some instruments – I was grouchy last week about LIGO – that only solve one problem.  But LSST is out there with the primary mission of making sure we don’t die by rock.  But as it’s out there discovering all these asteroids that are part of its primary mission, it’s also going to be turning up, potentially, tens of thousands of things that flicker, flare, and move in the night and helping us know about things that are so low probability that we’ve just never seen them before, helping us notice things that you have to have systematic observations with that kind of cadence.  It’s going to point out things that we can’t even speculate on, and it’s the fact that we can even speculate that is so cool because we know we haven’t watched the entirety of a stellar lifetime.  It’s going to allow us to see some many stars at once with sufficient detail that we’re going to fill in all of those details of a star’s life.</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	 The classic example of this surprise was things like dark energy where scientists were looking for one outcome and a completely surprising one came about, and it told us something about the universe that we had no idea.  Before 1998, we didn’t know that 76 percent, or whatever it is, of the universe – we didn’t even realize that was part of the equation.  And then suddenly, you now have to ask yourself, “What is that dark energy?”</p>
<p>Dr. Pamela Gay:	So this is actually even worse than that.  We had an equation that had the Lambda term, the term that we now use to express dark energy, and we made the choice to get rid of that term and say, “well, we see the universe is expanding.  Clearly, Lambda doesn’t have a value that stops the expansion of the universe.  Maybe it has a value, but that makes the math a whole lot harder so let’s not do that.  All of the test cases in cosmology books and everything was the end.  We assume Lambda equals zero, and, no. Lambda doesn’t equal zero, and to quote Chris Empian, one of my favorite moments of a talk ever, “Who ordered this?”  </p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	Yeah, that was most unexpected.  But as we go back to some of these missions – you look at the mission from New Horizons to Pluto.  We have lots of conversations with the mission scientists leading up to this, and I kept asking this question.  Really, come on, just between you and me, you’re looking for the stuff that you weren’t even expecting that you weren’t even planning that was going to happen.  </p>
<p>And, of course, that’s what they really want to see.  Of course, we’d like to measure the magnetic field, and we want to know what the atmosphere does.  But, hey, what a surprise, Charon and Pluto have vastly different terrains – sorry, Charon.  Charon has this enormous chasm on it.  Pluto has this incredibly young surface with glaciers of – or, sorry – mountains made of ice and glaciers of ammonia, stuff they never would’ve expected.</p>
<p>Dr. Pamela Gay:	And this is part of what’s so awesome about building versatile instrumentation.  SDSS is another one of those, “We’re just going to capture all the light and then see what we discover.”  You have the science you know is going to happen.  They knew they had a lot of science that would happen with certainty with Pluto.  But then you build the instruments flexible enough that when you realize, “Wow, okay.  The universe is more awesome than the human mind could ever imagine,” which is what we keep rediscovering because we can’t remember it for some reason.  Until we can consistently remember the universe is more awesome than we can imagine, we need to just keep building flexible instruments that serve many science purposes, and, luckily, that keeps us safe when it turns out we need to do things we hadn’t anticipated.</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	So let’s talk about policy for a second then, which is that if you had your way and we could direct science funding more, I guess, away from the cogitating over the stuff that, maybe, we can’t even know, where would you put the funding, he says throwing a softball?</p>
<p>Dr. Pamela Gay:	Yeah, it’s not a softball, and I don’t want to get hate mail.  I think there’s a lot to be said for things that aren’t necessarily kitchen sink instruments.  You have to have a certain amount of specificity.  </p>
<p>But having really good high resolution spectrographs that are capable for brighter objects giving us really detailed understanding of what the chemistry is out there so we can confine our models, having some really good high resolution imagers that allow us to start to get at fine structures, but then also have the stuff that just collects as much light as possible and throws it into a lower resolution setup so we can see what’s at the beginning of the universe.  At the end of the day, what you need is big glass, big collecting area – it’s not always glass.  Radio needs other things.</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	Right, x-rays – whatever.</p>
<p>Dr. Pamela Gay:	Attached both a really good high resolution set of instrumentation for the nearby universe and really good low resolution set for the most distant part of the universe.</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	If I could make this an analogy, it’s about listening to the universe as it is.  It’s about listening to nature and letting nature tell us how it functions and how it operates.  You need to build your theories, but the number of times – maybe the Higgs boson.  I can’t think of a lot of times where – neutrinos – you worked out the math in advance for a particle that you thought might be there or an object that you think is going to be there and then 10, 20, 30 years later the thing came about.  It’s a lot more about building those tools, getting them out there, collecting, and listening – being a really good listener – and then turning around and going, “What’s in here that weird?”  Let’s try and figure that out.</p>
<p>Dr. Pamela Gay:	And this comes down, in a lot of ways, to the Simon White Rocky Cold debate between high cost highly flexible instrumentation – the Hubbles of the universe – and the highly focused highly specialized instrumentation – Large Hadron Collider, WMAP Planck.  And there are times when you need the Large Hadron Collider to find your Higgs and find out if supersymmetry is another Nobel Prize for Weinberg or not.  But at the same time, I’m a huge fan of the ideals behind the great observatory program.  This was the program that gave us Hubble Space Telescope, Chandra, Fermi – </p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	Spitzer.</p>
<p>Dr. Pamela Gay:	I think Spitzer was one of the great observatories – just took us all the way through the electromagnetic spectrum where you should focus in space.  We didn’t launch radio telescopes – but gave us that full access to the universe.  Having that full access to the universe allows us to be nimble in the face of new science.</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	I think, though, the Large Hadron Collider fits more as a generic tool.  It’s a really powerful particle accelerator collider.  All of the particle discoveries have come out of more and more powerful particle accelerators.  So I think there’s value.  I wouldn’t see it as a single purpose tool.</p>
<p>Dr. Pamela Gay:	It’s very locked in on what it can collide and what energies it can access.  So there’s a lot of work that – it’s not slamming together atoms.  It’s not looking at a lot of the higher mass regime where you see things happening at the National Superconducting super collider – or National Superconducting Laboratory rather, at Michigan State University.  We still have Fermi Lab.  We still have various other laboratories that are building heavier elements.  </p>
<p>Unfortunately, colliders, there are some that are tuned really well for creating heavier and heavier elements, there are some that are tuned really, really well for making medical isotopes, and there are some that are designed for making discoveries at different energies.  LHC has a very narrow window on what it’s able to do, and this is why we have this whole suite of places that make atoms and molecules and particles go boom.</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	And I think that a lot of people make philosophical questions.  They try and make that a scientific question, and that comes up quite a lot.  You should read the comments on the YouTube Chat – YouTube channel of mine.  I ask, “What came before the Big Bang,” or things like that.  That’s the gist, like, this is a question that we can’t know, and yet, philosophy is what people turn to with certainty, which is not appropriate, I think.</p>
<p>Dr. Pamela Gay:	Yeah.  It’s the quote from R town that I may screw up slightly.  “Truth is only known by the poets, the drunks, and the mad.”</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	That’s awesome.  All right, on that note, thanks, Pamela.</p>
<p>Dr. Pamela Gay:	Thank you.</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	Which one are we?  Thanks.  We’ll talk to you next week.</p>
<p>Dr. Pamela Gay:	Okay, bye-bye.</p>

Fraser Cain:	Astronomy Cast episode 404, what we know, what we don’t know, and what we can’t know.  Welcome to Astronomy Cast, our weekly facts based journey through the cosmos.  We’ll help you understand not only what we know, but how we know what we know.  We say what we know and don’t know and can’t know quite a lot.  Wow.  My name’s Fraser Cain.  I’m the publisher of Universe Today, and with me is Dr. Pamela Gay, a professor at Southern Illinois University Edwardsville and the director of Cosmo Quest.  Hey, Pamela, how you doing?

Dr. Pamela Gay:	I’m doing well.  How are you doing?

Fraser Cain:	I don’t know.  I probably can’t know.  No, I know.  I’m doing good, doing good.  The weather is lovely here, and it’s that time where we come back around to spring and we notice it.

Dr. Pamela Gay:	It is true.  I bike rode 36 miles this weekend, lapping in as much sunlight as I could, but we were only having Indian summer.  So while my tulips are coming up, they’re going to get snowed on later this week.

Fraser Cain:	No, we’re done with snow.  It’s going to be nice from here on out.  Okay, cool.  So let’s do this episode.

Fraser Cain:	There are the things that we know, the things that we don’t know, and the things that we can’t know.  So how do we know which one is which when we’re deciding to find research and direct our scientific inquiry.  This just sounded like a great quote from – I can’t believe I’m saying this – Donald Rumsfeld.  I’m trying to remember the gist of it, but it was something like there’s the unknown – there’s no known –

Dr. Pamela Gay:	There’s the known.

Fraser Cain:	There are the known knowns, there are the known unknowns, there are the known – sorry – you have the known unknowns, and then there are the unknown unknowns, the ones that we don’t know that we don’t know.  And although it was used just five [inaudible] [00:02:58], it’s actually a really clever thing to categorize the world in, which is that when we direct our scientific inquiries, there’s this stuff that we already know.  We know gravity makes things fall, and we know mathematically.  

And then there’s the stuff that we know, but we just know that we don’t know it.  And then there’s the stuff that we don’t know that we don’t know, and then there’s a whole other class of stuff, which Rumsfeld forgot, which is that we can’t know it.  I think there’s a really good distinction that you put in.  So let’s go back to the beginning here and talk about – you queued this topic up this week.  What’s your philosophy here in approaching this?

Dr. Pamela Gay:	Well, we get lots and lots of questions coming in, everywhere from Twitter to Facebook, so on and so forth,</itunes:summary>

<p>Female Speaker 1:	This episode of Astronomy Cast is brought to you by Swinburne Astronomy Online.  The world’s longest running online Astronomy Degree program.  Visit astronomy.swin.edu.au for more information.</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	Astronomy Cast Episode 403: Funding Big Science. From Alma to LIGO to TNT.  Welcome to Astronomy Cast; our weekly facts-based journey through the cosmos.  We help you understand not only what we know but how we know what we know.  My name is Frazier Cain.  I’m the polisher in the universe today and with me is Dr. Pamela Gay, a professor at Southern Illinois University, Edwardsville, and the Director of Cosmo Quest.  Hey Pamela, how you doing?</p>
<p>Dr. Pamela Gay:	I’m doing well, how are you doing?</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	Awesome.  Super excited about the Gravitational Waves Announcement.  We, of course, predicted this years ago in Astronomy Cast.  But it’s nice to see modern times catching up with the stuff that we’ve explained for our listeners over the last couple of years.  </p>
<p>Dr. Pamela Gay:	But ya’ know?  It still wasn’t a sic sigma detection.  They have spent billions – well at least many, many millions and they have like one, low signal.  It’s a noise.  </p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	They’ll be more.  Don’t worry.</p>
<p>Dr. Pamela Gay:	There’s no way to predict that.  That’s the thing.  Anyways, I’ll shut up.  I’m being a curmudgeon.  I admit to this.</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	You are being a curmudgeon.</p>
<p>	Today’s episode of Astronomy Cast is brought to you by Casper Mattresses and I know we’ve mentioned Caspera few times in the past.  They are kind of an amazing new mattress company where instead of going to a showroom, they ship you the mattress through the mail in this crazy box.  It’s all sort off just like really squished in and then you open it up and the thing kind of expands.  And it’s great sort of hybrid foam mattress.  It’s got this latex foam and then also this memory foam.  The two work together as this mattress.</p>
<p>	Now I own – the story is like – they sent Pamela and myself sample mattresses.  I had to have mine sent to the states at the time so that my girlfriend, now wife in the states and I really love the mattress but we had to leave it there when my wife moved to Canada.  So, I bought a second one for our bed.  With my own dime and then I got another one for the spare bedroom because we needed another mattress in there.  So, I now have had three Casper Mattresses I’ve slept on and they’re great.  </p>
<p>	I really like them and I definitely stand behind these mattresses.  So, the cool thing about buying Casper Mattresses is it’s completely risk-free.  They offer free delivery, and return within a 100-day period.  So, that’ll give you the time to find out if you like the mattress or not.  So, it’s just the right balance.  You know, you’re really gonna like it.  Free trial, return policy.  The mattresses are made in America which is great.  So, you know they’re not coming from overseas.  And the prices are really reasonable.  So, $500.00 for a twin-size mattress.  $950.00 for a king-size mattress and you’ll find that’s the same price for much cheaper than some of the mattresses you would find in the store.</p>
<p>	So, to get a deal on your Casper Mattress all you have to do is go to Casper.com/Astro to and use the promo code Astro and they’ll knock $50.00 off the price of your mattress.  Now terms and conditions apply and you can get them in Canada as well.  Not just in the states.  So, once again go to Casper.com/Astro and use the promo code Astro to get $50.00 off of your mattress purchase.  All right.  Thanks Casper.  </p>

<p>Fraser Cain:	Big science takes big money and big observatories make some of the biggest science there is.  So, how do projects like this get conceived and funded and where does the money come from?</p>
<p>	We’ve been doing this show long enough and you’ve been involved in this long enough and you’ve actually gone through whole cycles.  You’ve been involved in helping pick big concepts.  Helping suggest missions.  So, this is really exciting.  You’ve been a part of this whole cycle which is great.</p>
<p>Dr. Pamela Gay:	Yeah.  I’m starting to feel old.  </p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	Like one of the elder states people of this whole situation.  It’s weird.  So, let’s go back.  Let’s talk about a big mission.  Like the 30-meter telescope which is one of the ones or the absurdly overwhelmingly large observatory.  In the end here’s this great big telescope perched atop a volcanic Hawaiian island.  How did it get from concept through funding to get to an actual construction?</p>
<p>Dr. Pamela Gay:	Well, so the TNT is actually currently cancelled but its budget is sitting there.  </p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	Well, let’s imagine, you know, it sits on the Canary Islands.  Whatever.  A big telescope perched atop of a Hawaiian volcanic island.  </p>
<p>Dr. Pamela Gay:	So, I think the key thing you brought up; this is a long process.  And our funding for these massive facilities comes from two different places.  It comes from the National Science Foundation and it comes from Nasa here in the United States.  And globally we’re looking at beyond the United States, the funding comes from government agencies and from universities in other nations.  </p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	Yeah.  We have the National Research Council here in Canada, is ours.</p>
<p>Dr. Pamela Gay:	So, when we’re looking to build these giant facilities like the Canada, France, Hawaii telescope, which is oddly located in Arizona; in these cases, you’re looking to build – actually no.  I lied.  That one is located in Hawaii.  It’s Win which is in Arizona.  When you’re looking –</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	Hawaii is our Nix Provence.  </p>
<p>Dr. Pamela Gay:	Right.  So, you have the Kenna, Hawaii, France telescope in Hawaii, you have Win which is, I believe, Wyoming.  Yale, something that begins with an I, National Optical Astronomy Observatory.  These are consortium telescopes.  And as we build bigger and bigger and bigger facilities, they stop being four-letter acronyms and they become groups of 30, 40, 50 different institutions and nations, each adding in their own chunk to the pie.</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	But I mean that’s two different creatures, right?  There’s the one of just having a like a single country like the United States, choosing a telescope, funding it and getting it built and then a consortium is like a whole other level of complexity.  You just added orders of magnitude to the complexity.  Can we just go back and figure how the single-country versions gets done?</p>
<p>Dr. Pamela Gay:	Well, the single-country one is getting more and more rare.  So, in either case the starting point is; you have a national vision for where science is going and you start with that vision.  Here in the United States we call it the decadal survey.  More and more nations are starting to come up with their own version of the decadal survey.  And these are where you get key players in the scientific field of your respective nation and make them write reports and white papers and more reports and more white papers until you end up with a massive document that details what they see as the most important science questions to be answered in the next ten years and detail what are the spacecraft?  What are the ground-based facilities that are needed to answer those questions?</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	And you were actually involved in the decadal survey.  So, how did that happen?  Like, did you get a call?  </p>
<p>Dr. Pamela Gay:	That’s actually how it happened.  </p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	Right.  So, someone call you and said, Pamela we need your help?</p>
<p>Dr. Pamela Gay:	Pretty much.  At the highest levels the National Research Council or National Academies of Science in the United States will enjoin panels.  And they start at the highest levels and these are the key players who then are like okay; so we need – no one person is an expert in everything and we admit to that most of the time.  And so, that top panel will be like, and we need to enjoin people to discuss star formation.  People to discuss gravitational lensing.  People to discuss extragalactic astronomy and star formation.  </p>
<p>And so, you get all of these different panels together.  Some of them are discussing ideas like increasing diversity.  Increasing education.  Others are trying to figure out what are the facilities that we need to move forward?  And so you end up with this tier of panels reporting to larger committees reporting to a core committee at the top that edits together a massive document that then goes to the National Science Foundation and to Nasa, and is used to set up funding goals.  And this is where you start seeing looking at how the National Science Foundation breaks apart the funding that they get from Congress and says okay; so now we’re going to spend this much on extragalactic.  This much on facilities.  This much on planetary science.  And that breakup reflects what’s needed to meet these decadal survey goals.</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	Okay.  So, you know, again, you got the call.  You joined the panel.  You guys make a bunch of recommendations.  Those recommendations they go to which?  To the funding agencies?  To the National Science Foundation and such?  Is that right?</p>
<p>Dr. Pamela Gay:	Yep.  Yes.</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	Okay.  So, let’s imagine; let’s say that you know, someone says we would like to understand dark matter better and so someone says we should make the Dark Matter Observatory.  </p>
<p>Dr. Pamela Gay:	Yeah.  That actually happened.  That’s pretty much how it occurred.  So, in this case dark energy was detailed as one of the most important problems we can try and solve.  And so, funding was set aside to go for the W First instrument and for the Dark Energy Explorer, the het decks on the Hobby Eberly telescope.  And so we have first of all, a many million-dollar instrument being built to go on a 9-meter telescope down in Texas and then an entire spacecraft that is working its way slowly towards construction and launch.  </p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	Okay.  So, somebody – a panel, a group at the National Science Foundation sets aside this budget?</p>
<p>Dr. Pamela Gay:	We’ll put out a call for proposals.  Yeah.</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	You’ll put out a call for proposals.  But who has approved the budget?  Is it the executive of the National Science Foundation or is it the government?  Who decides how much money is going to be spent?  </p>
<p>Dr. Pamela Gay:	Actually, at a certain level, is a mix of Congress and bureaucrats.  So, you have the President’s budget will say ‘and we wish to give this much to the NSF and this much to Nasa’ and there’s a certain amount of more detailed goals.  For instance, James Webb Space Telescope is a line item request.  And with all of these budgets put in, there is large chunks that are set aside, like this amount will go towards facilities.  </p>
<p>And then it’s in the hands of the folks at the National Science Foundation working through a competitive process to try and figure out; so of all of this facilities money that isn’t line-item allocations, how much of it goes towards things like the Arecibo radio telescope going?  How much of it goes towards keeping the VLA going?  And there are competitive processes where they say okay.  Let’s compete to run these different organizations.  And hey, anyone who has a good idea can compete.  </p>
<p>Now, you many not necessarily win if you don’t have the staffing and the support and the institution to support you.  But, it’s a competitive process where they come in and say we can do it for this amount of money.  We’re getting this amount of additional funding from our university, from our institution from partnerships with other institutions.  And over time you’ll actually see some facilities amount of funding change in terms of what’s paid for by the National Science Foundation versus what’s paid for out of individual university funding.  </p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	Right.  So, I can kind of imagine that the decadal survey comes together.  The recommendation is to build a dark energy, detect some kind of mission.  So, then the National Science Foundation or Nasa goes out and says, hey everybody.  Give us proposals for a mission that will help understand dark energy better.  And then people will come back and say, we can do it for $100,000,000.00.  We can do it for.  If you give us $5,000,000,000.00 we can come up with a really cool spacecraft.  </p>
<p>Dr. Pamela Gay:	They usually do cap it.  </p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	They cap – so, they say like, but don’t spend more than 300 million dollars.  Like, go crazy.  But not that crazy. Because we’re not gonna listen.</p>
<p>Dr. Pamela Gay:	Exactly.</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	Okay great.  So, the all the proposals come in and they pick one of the proposals?  And then they turn around –</p>
<p>Dr. Pamela Gay:	It’s one more –</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	So, one more proposal and then they turn around and say hey, we like this idea of this $300,000,000.00 mission.  Start building it?  Or like, give us another proposal or do they wanna turn around and take that idea and farm that out to a bunch of people?  And say okay.  We now know what that mission is gonna be.  We want all of you 10 people to propose to build this mission?  Or it’s the person who’s proposed the mission the one who’s then gonna build it?</p>
<p>Dr. Pamela Gay:	It can go both ways or all of the above actually.  So, for instance, if you have something that already exists that’s been around for a while they will re-compete management of it on a six to ten-year basis depending on what the facility is.  So, the people who are running the very large array today, who are in fact running the National Radio Astronomy Observatory today.  Those may not be the same people.  Those may not be the same organizations.  So, they will re-compete the entire organization on a regular basis.  </p>
<p>	Now, at a lower level, they will also say; okay, so, we really like your idea for this big-picture instrument.  And say, Nasa is the person funding the spacecraft; because Nasa funds spacecraft.  Now, we’re gonna compete out all the instruments on that spacecraft.  So, they fund one body to be the main cooperative agreement or grant holder depending on the size of the spacecraft.  And not they’re gonna compete out the instruments.  </p>
<p>	So, this can go down to a very fine level of; we like your idea but.  Or hey, it’s a small project.  Go for it.  We trust you to do it on your own.  It all depends on how much money is involved.  How much they’re gonna micro-manage you and how much they’re likely to re-compete your idea along the way.  Potentially even removing you from your own idea.  </p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	Well, that’s it.  That’s gotta be heartbreaking, right?  Is that you proposed a really clever idea for some cool coronagraph that nobody’s thought of, and it’s intriguing enough of an idea that you really need to put it back out to ten different people to see who can build you a coronagraph for the amount of money that you can afford who has the – you know, the person who comes up with the idea isn’t necessarily the team that’s best equipped to actually build the final project.  So, I can imagine that’s a little frustrating.</p>
<p>	So, okay.  So, we’ve got the situation.  We’ve got the – they’ve gone out for proposals.  The proposals come back.  One of the proposals is chosen for say $300,000,000.00.  How does the funding then flow to the people who are gonna build this thing?</p>
<p>Dr. Pamela Gay:	It’s usually through a cooperative agreement process.  And it’s not gonna be $300,000,000.00.  The entire budget for facilities for the National Science Foundation is like $150,000,000.00 to fund everything.</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	Well, I was thinking; okay, like a new telescope, a 30-meter telescope.  That’s gonna cost big money to build.</p>
<p>Dr. Pamela Gay:	Right.  But they’re not gonna fund all of it up front.  And it’s still not gonna cost that much money.  A lot of people don’t really understand the full range and cost for these different facilities.  So, we’re used to dealing with numbers like the Hubble Space Telescope; $2,500,000,000,000.00.  But when we start looking at ground-based facilities, our most cutting-edge crazy facilities where we had to build the road there.  Things like that we’re looking at the Atacama Telescope, ALMA.  The radio array down in South America.  That is as hard a project as you get.  That was $1,400,000,000,000.00.  </p>
<p>	When you look at the large synoptic survey telescope, it’s entire cost for the National Science Foundation part is $466,000,000.00.  So, it’s a much less expensive project.  And that’s spread out over a couple of decades.  Where the most expensive year that it has slated, they’re looking at $100,000,000.00 and that year it pretty much eats all the facilities budget for everybody by itself, already.</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	Right.  So, but the point being that they are feeding that money in tranches over very long periods of time.</p>
<p>Dr. Pamela Gay:	Yes.  And this is how we can do these projects.  </p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	Right.  And if you failed to deliver on your milestones, somebody else can be selected to take over and finish the project.</p>
<p>Dr. Pamela Gay:	Or, they just can it.  There is a history of that happening.  We were working in Texas.  And by we, I mean people much older than me because I was still in college.  There was a large synchrotron cyclotron that was being built under Texas.  It was out of Waco ?</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	The super-conducting, super-collider?</p>
<p>Dr. Pamela Gay:	Yeah.  And Congress didn’t like it.  It was going over budget.  It was behind schedule and they didn’t like it.  And so they cancelled the project and it probably actually cost them more money to close out the project than it would’ve for them to let it just keep going.</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	Right.  Okay.  So, now I will permit the more complicated version of this story, which is the international-collaboration-size.  So, like you just discussed, that’s how it works if it’s just an American-only or just a Canadian – and it’s only our National Research Council.  So, what if it’s gonna be an international collaboration?  How does that come together?  And how does the money flow?  </p>
<p>Dr. Pamela Gay:	So, there you end up usually working with a central organization that gets formed to run the facility.  And it may be running through a single university that has to put together all of these partnerships and that central university is the one that maintains the risk.  You put together in some cases, full international treaty’s on ‘and German shall provide this much money, and Italy shall provide this much money’ and in exchange for providing that much money they get a certain share of the scientific time on the instrument.  </p>
<p>	So, you’re looking at a certain number of nights where they get as particular as ‘this institution will get this many dark nights, and this many grey nights and this much bright time’ and it’s very particular.  So that you know exactly what you’re getting for your dollars.  And sometimes, it’s not a specific ‘and we’re going to contribute this much money’.  It’s going to be instead ‘and we’re going to contribute this instrument and in that case the institution that’s supplying the instrument is taking on, in some ways, even a greater risk.  Because it could be that that instrument ends up costing them more than they thought.  </p>
<p>	So, it’s a very detailed set of contracts that go into place and you can end up on real trouble sometimes.  The Gemini telescope ran into issues a few years ago where the United Kingdom was like, and we’re no longer going to be supporting this.  So, suddenly you have a national government saying, we’re out.  No more money for you.  And Gemini still had to figure out how to pay its bills.  And the US is actually kind of notorious for doing this to international collaborations to build spaceships where we’re like, and we’re no longer gonna be helping you build your spaceship.  Or, we’re gonna do this all by ourselves.</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	We’ve got a new President.  </p>
<p>Dr. Pamela Gay:	Yeah.  This happens.  We’re kind of bastards.  </p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	Oh.  So, I can imagine, right, the complexities of this.  Like on the one end if you have something really simple, like it’s just a telescope and we’re all gonna collaborate our money.  Some agency is the lead, right?  And then – it could be government or it could be a university or it could be a research institution.  And then they sign on part of it – I guess they do horse-trading to say; we need another $30,000,000,000.00.  We’ll give you 1/7 of our observing time in exchange for your $30,000,000,000.00.  You can have, you know, it’s like the way now my children negotiate; you can have every second Wednesday.  You can use the observatory or they can say, we need a specific instrument.  A very special kind of camera and you Italians are really have a lot of experience in making these kinds of cameras, so would you be willing to contribute that special camera to this telescope and in exchange you can use the telescope?  Or your institutions can use it on these nights, those nights, whatever.</p>
<p>	So, like on the one hand it really, it allows observatories to be built that just could never be built by any one country, any one research institution, whatever.  But it generates a level of complexity and international trade law, etc. that’s just gotta be – you know, the bureaucracy’s just gotta be overwhelming. </p>
<p>Dr. Pamela Gay:	Well, it’s – the bureaucracy in the grand scheme of things, the Pacific Trade Agreements.  Those are much more complicated.  The real problem is the fact that once an instrument is going, once a facility is going, it really is possible for random partner to drop out and to essentially kill the entire project and everyone loses all of their money that has already been spent.  And this is where you can get a lot of animosity.  </p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	Right.  And these exist, right?  There are half-build instruments out there that the funding just ran out and people pulled out and they just never got built.  </p>
<p>Dr. Pamela Gay:	Yeah.  And in trying to look at all of this, the scientists are kind of caught in the middle.  Because on one hand, we desperately want to see all of our facilities kept in place.  But as the horse-trading goes on, we end up seeing things like right now, Arecibo is yet again, at risk.  And it seems like Congress and NSF and NRAO have been systematically trying to get rid of Arecibo every year or two as long as I’ve been an adult.  </p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	Yeah.</p>
<p>Dr. Pamela Gay:	It’s just one of those facilities they keep trying to kill.   </p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	And it’s the coolest facility.</p>
<p>Dr. Pamela Gay:	Well, it’s one of the cool ones and it’s doing solid science.  It’s just not doing the sexy stuff that completely grabs every single headline.  It’s doing the really necessary stuff and unfortunately –</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	But isn’t it the observatory that made contact with aliens?  Or maybe I’m thinking of a book.</p>
<p>Dr. Pamela Gay:	Yeah.  I think that’s kind of a movie.  </p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	Okay.  A movie.  Yeah.  </p>
<p>Dr. Pamela Gay:	But it is the observatory that keeps imaging asteroids as they come tumbling past and help us to accurately measure their distances.  Being able to accurately measure the distance to an asteroid kind helps us know if we’re gonna die or not and I’m in a favor – I’m in favor of knowing if we’re going to die.</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	Right.  So, do you think though, I mean – with a lot of the low-hanging fruit has been plucked.  The, you know, the easier discoveries.  You know, we discovered Uranus, we discovered Neptune.  We have determined a bunch of moons of Saturn.  We’ve been able to see some Kuiper belt objects, that we’re moving into this future where the bigger and bigger science is gonna require much bigger, much more expensive instruments.  Things like the 30-meter telescope.  The ? was it the overwhelmingly large telescope?  The, you know, whatever –</p>
<p>Dr. Pamela Gay:	Extraordinarily large telescope.</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	Extraordinarily large.  Whatever comes after the large hadron collider that these international collaborations of big science are gonna be the rule.  And that’s the only way that you’re gonna be able to keep pushing the boundaries out is with ever more larger observatories.  I mean you could build an observatory or the 30- meter telescope will Hubble’s butt when it finally gets built from the ground, right?  It’ll kick it’s butt all the way from the ground up into orbit.  But the thing has –</p>
<p>Dr. Pamela Gay:	This is why we’re not replacing Hubble.  </p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	Right.  But you need these.  So, do you see this being, like, this is the rule?  We better buckle down and get better an international science law?</p>
<p>Dr. Pamela Gay:	I see it as actually a problem.  So, right now we have this trend where in order to answer the cutting-edge, we haven’t got a clue, kind of problems.  We need to build these many, many billion dollar facilities.  And as we build more and more of these billion-dollar facilities, they eat up more and more of the overall facilities maintenance budget.  LIGO which I’m a curmudgeon about cost $30,000,000.00 a year to maintain.  Out of a budget that’s $100,000,000.00 to $120,000,000.00 a year from the National Science Foundation.</p>
<p>	So, you’re looking at one facility that has been running since the mid-90’s and has made a single detection in that entire time that wasn’t even a sic sigma detection.  I am a curmudgeon.</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	Totally.</p>
<p>Dr. Pamela Gay:	I am into this.  But it’s eating a huge, huge portion of the budget in hopes of making detections that confirm theories.  It’s not even trying to push our understanding into new directions.  It’s trying to say, yes, our understanding is correct.  </p>
<p>	As we build more and more of these single-purpose, single-science facilities, we are losing our ability to find out what we don’t know.  Which is a really weird thing to say.  But if you think about it, LIGO is my pet peeve because I look at its entire budget and I’m like, why didn’t we kill this and build LISA and just have higher quality in orbit?  Personal problem.  I admit to this.  I’m a curmudgeon about LIGO.</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	Get over it already.  Come on.</p>
<p>Dr. Pamela Gay:	No.</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	Work through it.  Talk to your therapist.</p>
<p>Dr. Pamela Gay:	So, we have Planck and we have WMAP which have done outstanding things that have changed our understanding of the expansion of the universe.  But at the end of the day, these were instruments that were built to study a single thing; the cosmic microwave background.  They did have some ancillary science they could do but it was limited ancillary science. </p>
<p>	With the hadron collider we have something that was designed to look for the Higgs boson.  That’s where the majority of its budget ended up going.  It is going to potentially do ancillary additional science looking for additional particles.  But we’re spending huge portions of our budget on these facilities that can do a thing.  </p>
<p>	Now luckily we do have other things out there like the large synoptic survey telescope that has a primary purpose of making sure we don’t die by asteroid.  But in the process of doing that primary purpose, it’s going to do probably more discovery of things we don’t even know exist than like, everything else out there.</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	Yeah.  We talked to a guest on the Weekly Space Hangout that it’s gonna potentially find thousands of supernova each pass.  </p>
<p>Dr. Pamela Gay:	Now, we have a problem with this, though.  In putting such a huge portion of our budget into these single-purpose instruments, LSST is a survey instrument.  We don’t have any telescopes left to follow-up on what they discover.  There’s a few out there.  But universities are closing them up in favor of these giant systems.  If we don’t have those 4-meter telescopes out there on what LSST discovers, how the heck do we turn these discoveries into real understanding?</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	But that sounds like it’s a sort of a balancing act that will never be complete, right?  That you’ll be like, you’ll get ahead on the one place.  You’ll be like oh, we’ve got too many single-purpose instruments that are turning out too much data and we don’t can’t do follow-up observations, so then the next round of funding will encourage a bunch of the more general-purpose instruments, and then you’re like, yeah but we’ve got these specific questions we really need answered and it’ll just go back and forth.  </p>
<p>Dr. Pamela Gay:	See, there’s a problem with that logic versus reality.  And the problem is reality is we’re in a flat-budget scenario.  If you’re in flat-budget scenario every time you build a new instrument you have to kill an old one.  So, this means that we don’t get to keep the general-purpose telescopes that allow us to follow-up on what the single-purpose ones find, if we build the single-purpose ones.  And as we’re building more and more of this hyper-expensive facilities, the ALMA’s of the world, these hyper-expensive facilities, they wipe out a large number of the small facilities.  </p>
<p>	One of the most terrifying things I saw is all of Kitt Peak National Observatory is currently somewhat in jeopardy.  All of it.  This is one of the great observatories in North America.  And we may have to shut it down because we have too many other things like LSST that we’re trying to figure out how to pay for.</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	Okay fine; you’re in charge.  You’re in charge.  I hereby elect you Queen of Funding.  And you can magically disappear any parts that you don’t like.  And every project will come in on budget, on time.  What would you do?</p>
<p>Dr. Pamela Gay:	I have to admit that I would want things that were highly productive.  LSST fits that model of highly productive science.  </p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	Yeah.  Don’t you take that away from me.  </p>
<p>Dr. Pamela Gay:	Right.  So, things that are out there and the data-per-dollar is high.  I am in favor of using that as something of a criteria and this is what makes me so curmudgeonly about LIGO is you don’t have a lot of data-per-dollar.  I thing that when it comes to projects that are low data-per-dollar, we need to spread out that budget so far that no one nation is really suffering under the weight of it.  </p>
<p>	When we look at things like LIGO, those are international collaborations, but that is $30,000,000.00 a year that we’re looking at in the numbers I found.  And I admit I didn’t reconfirm them on the NSF website because the NSF website left me scratching my head.  But he number I was finding was $30,000,000.00 a year to maintain it and that’s huge.  That could go into so much other science.</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	All right.  Well, on that note, thank you so much Pamela.  </p>

Fraser Cain:	Astronomy Cast Episode 403: Funding Big Science. From Alma to LIGO to TNT.  Welcome to Astronomy Cast; our weekly facts-based journey through the cosmos.  We help you understand not only what we know but how we know what we know.  My name is Frazier Cain.  I’m the polisher in the universe today and with me is Dr. Pamela Gay, a professor at Southern Illinois University, Edwardsville, and the Director of Cosmo Quest.  Hey Pamela, how you doing?

Dr. Pamela Gay:	I’m doing well, how are you doing?

Fraser Cain:	Awesome.  Super excited about the Gravitational Waves Announcement.  We, of course, predicted this years ago in Astronomy Cast.  But it’s nice to see modern times catching up with the stuff that we’ve explained for our listeners over the last couple of years.  

Dr. Pamela Gay:	But ya’ know?  It still wasn’t a sic sigma detection.  They have spent billions – well at least many, many millions and they have like one, low signal.  It’s a noise.  

Fraser Cain:	They’ll be more.  Don’t worry.

Dr. Pamela Gay:	There’s no way to predict that.  That’s the thing.  Anyways, I’ll shut up.  I’m being a curmudgeon.  I admit to this.

Fraser Cain:	You are being a curmudgeon.

	Today’s episode of Astronomy Cast is brought to you by Casper Mattresses and I know we’ve mentioned Caspera few times in the past.  They are kind of an amazing new mattress company where instead of going to a showroom, they ship you the mattress through the mail in this crazy box.  It’s all sort off just like really squished in and then you open it up and the thing kind of expands.  And it’s great sort of hybrid foam mattress.  It’s got this latex foam and then also this memory foam.  The two work together as this mattress.

	Now I own – the story is like – they sent Pamela and myself sample mattresses.  I had to have mine sent to the states at the time so that my girlfriend, now wife in the states and I really love the mattress but we had to leave it there when my wife moved to Canada.  So, I bought a second one for our bed.  With my own dime and then I got another one for the spare bedroom because we needed another mattress in there.  So, I now have had three Casper Mattresses I’ve slept on and they’re great.  

	I really like them and I definitely stand behind these mattresses.  So, the cool thing about buying Casper Mattresses is it’s completely risk-free.  They offer free delivery, and return within a 100-day period.  So, that’ll give you the time to find out if you like the mattress or not.  So, it’s just the right balance.  You know, you’re really gonna like it.  Free trial, return policy.  The mattresses are made in America which is great.  So, you know they’re not coming from overseas.  And the prices are really reasonable.  So, $500.00 for a twin-size mattress.  $950.00 for a king-size mattress and you’ll find that’s the same price for much cheaper than some of the mattresses you would find in the store.

	So, to get a deal on your Casper Mattress all you have to do is go to Casper.com/Astro to and use the promo code Astro and they’ll knock $50.00 off the price of your mattress.  Now terms and conditions apply and you can get them in Canada as well.  Not just in the states.  So, once again go to Casper.com/Astro and use the promo code Astro to get $50.00 off of your mattress purchase.  All right.  Thanks Casper.</itunes:summary>

<p>Announcer:	This episode of Astronomy Cast is brought to you by Swinburne Astronomy Online, the world’s longest running online astronomy degree program. Visit astronomy.swin.edu.au for more information.</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	Astronomy Cast, Episode 402, Gravity Eyes: See the Invisible with the Force.  Welcome to Astronomy Cast, our weekly facts-based journey through the cosmos.  We’ll help you understand not only what we know, but how we know what we know.  My name is Fraser Cain, I’m the publisher of Universe Today and with me is Dr. Pamela Gay, a professor at Southern Illinois University, Edwardsville, and the director of CosmoQuest.  Hey, Pamela, how you doing?</p>
<p>Pamela Gay:	I’m doing well.  Like so much of the U.S., I’m getting snowed on today and snow is always really exciting.</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	Really?  Oh, it’s so warm here; it’s like 13 degrees, it’s beautiful, sunny –</p>
<p>Pamela Gay:	That’s Celsius, everyone.  That’s Celcius.</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	Yeah, we’re done with winter, we’re into spring.  This is, you know, the groundhog didn’t see his shadow so it’s smooth sailing from here on out.  </p>
<p>Pamela Gay:	See, our groundhog stopped hibernating yesterday.  Like, she was out eating the grass and then today she’s getting snowed on.  So we basically went from being like 15, 20 degrees Celsius to being 15, 20 degrees Fahrenheit and yeah, groundhogs weren’t meant for that.  </p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	Just to be clear, groundhog, this is the Punxsutawney groundhog, which is obviously the most accurate method of weather forecasting known to man.  Take that, NASA, NOAA. </p>
<p>Pamela Gay:	Whereas my groundhog is named George.</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	Really?  So do you detect, do you do your weather forecasting with your local groundhog and not the official Punxsutawney Phil groundhog?</p>
<p>Pamela Gay:	So Kyle goes strictly, my husband, goes strictly by the Pennsylvania groundhog and I simply hope that ours doesn’t die and that’s about where we’re at, and other that, I like satellites.  I really do like my weather to come from satellites.  I’m kind of weird that way. </p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	Yeah, we don’t believe in astrology and we don’t believe in groundhogs.  </p>
<p>Pamela Gay:	Well, no.  I believe in groundhogs existing, I just don’t believe their forecasts.</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	I’m not sure they’re even real.  But let’s get on with this episode of Astronomy Cast.  </p>

<p>Fraser Cain:	So we stand on the brink of a potential announcement of direct detection of gravitational waves, as predicted by Einstein, but there are plenty of things we can detect with gravity, like planets, black holes, and other hidden objects.  So today, let’s get into it.  All right, Pamela.  So, yeah, this is not a total coincidence.  We are riding the wave of a potential prediction of direct detection of gravitational waves.  So what’s the rumor mill churning right now as we’re recording?</p>
<p>Pamela Gay:	So the rumor mill, as I understand it, is first there was Lawrence Krauss tweeted something and it was right after he got a text message or an email in his phone and then really quickly undid that, and this was followed by a bunch of people working with LIGO being asked to please lock away some days in March; don’t go anywhere, we need you all here.  I’ve heard rumors of a media event.  I haven’t seen an invitation to the press yet.  And there’s always this sort of back-of-the-mind, well Krauss really doesn’t work for LIGO and LIGO has kind of been in the news with Chris Ott a lot lately, so there could be a whole lot of stuff going on here.  </p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	Right, so if we’re lucky, by the time you’re hearing this, maybe –<br />
Pamela Gay:	No, it’ll be after that, hopefully.</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	After you’re hearing this, but shortly after you hear this, there will be the announcement of the direct detection of gravitational waves as predicted by Einstein.  And if we’re unlucky, there will be some other interesting event that is cool, but it’s not, you know, the big Holy Grail, and if we’re super unlucky, everyone’s just getting all the signals wrong and there’s nothing to be said and it’s just business as usual.</p>
<p>Pamela Gay:	Or there’s nothing scientific to be said.  </p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	Yeah, like –</p>
<p>Pamela Gay:	It would awesome if they got LISA fully funded and were announcing that, but I don’t think that’s what it is. </p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	That would, yeah, that would be pretty great.  Yeah, or like another upgrade to LIGO being developed, or as you – I mean, you mentioned this a little, like last week, that maybe like they’re gonna throw in the towel on LIGO.  It’s just impossible.  It can’t be done.</p>
<p>Pamela Gay:	Well, I don’t think they’re going to announce they’re throwing in the towel.  That’s too many jobs.  But there’s been so much going on in terms of LISA, in terms of sexual harassment, in terms of rumored detections.  We don’t know.  We just know there’s something coming, but they’re not the only gravitational news in town.  We’ve had the Planet Nine theoretical detection by folks also at Caltech.  So apparently, if you want to detect things using anything but light, Caltech is the place to be right now.  So we have Michael Brown and his team –</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	‘Pluto killer,’ Mike Brown.</p>
<p>Pamela Gay:	Gave us another ninth planet, he taketh and he giveth.  </p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	Giveth, yeah.</p>
<p>Pamela Gay:	And then I saw more announcements yesterday about planets being, not planets, about galaxies being discovered behind the disk of the Milky Way and that just sort of reminded me of the Great Attractor.  So there’s so much in our universe that we only see with gravity and heck, dark matter is one of the major constituents of the unseen universe.<br />
Fraser Cain:	All right, we’ll start with dark matter then.  So, I mean, we’ve done a bunch of shows on dark matter, but let’s you know, reiterate of course here that we know dark matter exists purely by detecting its gravity. </p>
<p>Pamela Gay:	Exactly, and this is something that goes back to Vera Rubin’s work well before I was born, before a lot of us were born.  She, while working on her doctoral dissertation, was studying the rotation of galaxies and then folks has also been studying the rotation of gas clouds in the outer wings of our own galaxy, and when you put all of this data together, galaxies don’t rotate the way one would expect based on the visible mass, based on what we see.  And this is continued as we’ve pushed what we’re able to see out into redder wavelengths in the radio and bluer wavelengths out through the gamma rays.  We don’t actually detect any of the stuff that we’re looking for with gamma rays, but still.  </p>
<p>So the more we look with light, we still haven’t been able to account for all of the matter that orbital dynamics for how galaxies rotate, including our own galaxy.  We just can’t account for anything, so that tells us there’s a bunch of matter that we can’t see.  We named it dark matter because we lack originality.  </p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	But that was the first, that was the first hint of it, but then astronomers have come up with much better techniques to map it out with tremendous accuracy.</p>
<p>Pamela Gay:	Right, so fast-forward until just the past decade and just within the history of this show, we’ve begun to use techniques looking at how basically what appeared to be voids and empty space seemed to warp background light by shifting the path of the light with gravity.  All of these minor shifts add up to gravitational lensing events that tell us where all of the hidden matter, at least where a lot of the hidden matter is located.  We’ve seen this in colliding galaxies and galaxy clusters.  The Bullet Cluster was the first big detection.  We’ve seen that repeated several times.  Now we have surveys like COSMOS that have looked through basically tubes through space and measured everything up in that region and looked at how the density of dark matter and the clustering of dark matter has changed over the evolution of the universe.  </p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	Yeah, and so it’s hilarious, right?  We don’t even know what this stuff is, but we can use it as a telescope to probe and understand its distribution and location and even to see things that are further away, that we couldn’t normally see.  But thanks to the dark matter, you can actually use it as a telescope, which is just amazing.</p>
<p>Pamela Gay:	And what Fraser is talking about is massive gravitational lenses, where we used often the central galaxy and galaxy clusters, the big old cd galaxies, to gravitationally lens background objects like quasars and the combined visible mass and gravitational mass, well that’s a whole lot of mass that can do a whole lot of light bending, and in some cases we can actually catch both – things that are otherwise so – we couldn’t see them, or catch things that we didn’t see it happen in the original go, so we catch it as it comes back around on the bent path towards Earth. </p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	Yeah, okay so that’s sort of like the one way that we use gravity to sense our surroundings.  Let’s talk another one.  I think let’s talk about Planet Nine, and this is you know, we introed this a bit, which is Mike Brown giveth and Mike Brown taketh away.  He took away Pluto, but he helped maybe give us a whole ‘nother planet that’s way bigger than Pluto.   	</p>
<p>Pamela Gay:	Right, exactly.  So this isn’t the first time this has happened.  When we look at the paths of planets, we can see anomalies that either have to be accounted for in the history of the solar system, so like, how did Uranus end up spilled over on its side, or they have to be accounted for by another mass being out there yanking things around.  So when we were first trying to understand the orbit of Uranus, there was this idea that maybe there was another massive, or at least as massive as ice giants get, another massive planet out there that was pulling on Uranus’s orbit.  And folks made a bunch of different predictions and there was both a British team and a French team that observationally went looking based on these mathematical predictions, and that’s how we found Neptune. </p>
<p>	Now, there were similar predictions that Neptune’s orbit was screwed up because of another planet, which is what originally sent us hunting for Pluto, except it turns out that you can kind of like account for Neptune in other ways so that wasn’t necessary.  But we found Pluto, so cool nonetheless, except Pluto wasn’t the massive planet that folks were looking for.  It was a little blob of ice.  And even back in the days after Clyde Tombaugh had first found it, people were like, “This is not a planet.”  And low and behold, fast-forward until ten years ago, and Michael Brown started finding lots of other objects that are close in size to Pluto, are similar orbital characteristics, they’re out in the Kuiper belt out there, and folks were like, “Yep, Pluto’s not a planet.  Demote.”  And so that’s how Michael Brown got his name ‘Pluto Killer.’  </p>
<p>Well, this year, in looking at a bunch of the different objects that he detected, many of which still have, well, zip codes.  So we have the orbit Sedna, of 2012 GB174, 2012 VP113, 2013 RF98, 2004 VN112, and 2007 TG422.  All of these un-sexily named objects, well Sedna has a cool name, but all of their orbits are pointed in one direction out of our solar system and so these are highly elliptical orbits.  In better English terms, they’re flattened ovals, where the sun is closer to one side of the oval than the other.  And all of those ovals are pointing off in one direction.  And to keep all of them pointed off in one direction it implies that there must be something counter-balancing their orbit.  And we know that Pluto and Neptune, for instance, have a resonance that will cause them never to collide, even though their orbits vaguely overlap.  And similar rules seem to indicate there must be something out there that’s keeping all of these objects from, well having orbits that are more evenly spread about the sun.  And running models, doing the maths, the entire team came up with there must be a ninth planet out there, something that is many times the size of the Earth, and this was theoretical work that was done by Konstantin Batygin.</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	Right, and so the – and this isn’t the first time these predictions have been made.  I remember there was a, was it a Spanish team?  There was a Mexican team that had done some prediction.  It was a Mexican astronomer, yeah, had done some predictions and sort of made these same kind of calculations that there was either a Mars sized object that’s relatively close or a Neptune sized object that’s much further out.  </p>
<p>Pamela Gay:	And this has to do a lot with the Kuiper belt cliff, this observed lack of Kuiper belt objects out past 55 AU.</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	Yeah, and another part of it is this sort of idea that, you know, why do we get some of these long period comets?  There’s got to be something out there that’s interacting with the Kuiper belt system, with the Oort cloud system out there, really far out, farther away than we can see.  And so this is the point, right, which is that the prediction is made, with thanks to gravity, for the actual observational predication is made with a telescope, right.  Now astronomers need to follow up with some kind of observatory to actually find this thing.  It should theoretically be visible within the most sensitive telescopes, within James Webb or Hubble, things like that.<br />
Pamela Gay:	And the trick for finding this object is catching it in the act of moving because, well it’s reflecting sunlight so it’s going to appear, in a lot of ways, like a solar-type thing, depending on exactly how it reflects the different colors of light.  It may end up having a slightly different black body depending on how it reflects light.  But if we don’t catch that sucker moving, we’re not gonna notice that it’s really in our own solar system, so there needs to be repeat observations in the same area with high sensitivity, with high astrometric accuracy that are staggered in time and we’re just not quite there yet.  This is the kind of thing where, assuming LSST has the right parts of the sky in its field of view. </p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	Right, that’s the large synoptic survey telescope and this is the, this is gonna be, I think, you know, one of the most important observatories, most important scientific tools that’s ever been built.</p>
<p>Pamela Gay:	Yes.</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	And I’m gonna keep sort of hyping everybody about this thing because it’s such an amazing observatory.  It’s gonna scan the whole sky at a very high –</p>
<p>Pamela Gay:	Visible in the Southern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	In the Southern Hemisphere, at a very high level of resolution within, I think, four days.  It’s gonna have mapped out the whole sky.  It’s gonna find asteroids, supernova.  It’s gonna find – you know, we were talking to an astronomer.  He figures thousands of supernovae because it’s gonna be able to observe all of these galaxies very carefully.  So you’re gonna have this, we’re gonna see this world of motion that astronomers have never really been that, you know, have never had a chance to really peer into unless it was just like luck, happened to find a supernova or something.  </p>
<p>Pamela Gay:	They’re estimating upwards of 10,000 transient objects every single night, which includes the supernova, which includes flare stars, which includes all of the little variable things that you otherwise wouldn’t have noticed.  It includes asteroids; it includes potentially Kuiper belt objects.  So LSST is just gonna systematically find, well it’s primary mission is to find everything that might hit us, but beyond that it’s going to give us vast insights into the background universe around us.  </p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	So, that’s great.  Now, we’ve talked about planets in our solar system, but there’s another method of using gravity to find planets in other solar systems, right?  There’s two; there’s gravitational microlensing and there’s the rate of velocity method, which is all about gravity.</p>
<p>Pamela Gay:	Right.  So one of the cool things that we did actually trying to find dark matter initially, was there were a couple of different gravitational microlensing experiments set up.  One of the cooler ones in terms of names was the MACHO Project, there was also OGLE, and MACHO was out there pointed vaguely towards the Magellanic clouds and while it was monitoring all of these stars, it was looking to see if any of the stars would suddenly get significantly brighter in light, in a way that was characteristic of a foreground object closer to us passing in front of this background galaxy, and as it passed between us observing that background star, it would gravitationally bend light from that star that otherwise wouldn’t have reached us, to come toward us, make the thing appear much brighter.  </p>
<p>The hope was, well maybe we’d find a whole bunch of dim white dwarfs, a whole bunch of rogue stellar mass black holes, neutron stars.  A bunch of condensed matter objects that would, in their happy degenerate state, account for all of the dark matter out there.  Well, we didn’t find that, but what we did find is, well there are stars out there that do microlens things and sometimes those stars have planets and you’ll get a large microlensing event from the star and a smaller microlensing event from a planet in orbit around it that just happens to line up just right.  </p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	Yeah, and even like moons potentially, you know, you’re gonna get, that’s still in the works, and what I love about this technique is that amateur astronomers even participate in helping to find these things because the difference in brightness is so significant that even a fairly small, you know, a right equipped telescope can see these things.</p>
<p>Pamela Gay:	And exactly how much microlensing we see, whether or not we see microlensing from that giant moon or not, depends on the sensitivity of the equipment, but the star microlensing a background star, easily detectable.  In fact, the MACHO project engaged a whole bunch of southern hemisphere scientists, and by scientists, I mean guys in their backyard, women in their driveways pointing their telescopes up and letting us know what they were seeing.  </p>
<p>Fraser Cain: 	Yeah, citizen scientists, our favorite kind.<br />
Pamela Gay:	Exactly, exactly.   </p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	Okay, great.  So, let’s talk about the rate of velocity, because again, you’re really watching the gravity move a star around.</p>
<p>Pamela Gay:	And this is, again, something that we’ve done an entire episode on.  One of the great ways that we started finding planets was by very carefully measuring the rate at which stars are either moving toward the Earth or away from the Earth.  If nothing else was intervening you’d expect this to be pretty much a constant velocity, but the thing is, if there’s a planet going around the star, the entire system is orbiting around a central point as a center of mass.  And as the star goes around and around that center of mass, its motion isn’t a lot.  In fact, it might only be moving at the same rate that a human being might be moving and so you’re looking at a meter per second velocity shift and it’s not moving all that far either.  It’s not like the Earth that has a 1 AU radius circle that it goes around each year.  But those small, sometimes meter per second motions are entirely visible by Earth-bound spectroscopes and so we look for that little wiggle in the motion and the velocity of the star that’s causes by its planet or planets yanking it around.</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	One of my favorite stories in using gravity to find something was the search for the supermassive black hole at the heart if the Milky Way because once again, you’ve got this gravitational interaction with this object that’s four million times the mass of our sun, with stars nearby it and they are buzzing around it like comets. </p>
<p>Pamela Gay:	And this is work being done by Andrea Ghez, who is at UCLA, and she’s using the Keck telescope and a technique called drizzle, where you take high-speed images that, because they’re so fast, the light doesn’t have time to get smeared out by the atmosphere.  Then you have to co-align to take into account that one image, the atmosphere will have moved the stars one direction, another image the atmosphere will have moved the light from the stars another direction.  So you co-align all of these images and then over days, weeks, months, and now, well more than a decade, she has been able to build up the motion of the innermost visible stars in our galaxy and see these things going at significant fractions the speed of light as they zip around an extremely dense object that, at this point, we have to say is a supermassive black hole.  </p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	Yeah, if not, it’s something that sure is kind of like a supermassive black hole.  If you don’t believe in black holes, fine.  Explain that.</p>
<p>Pamela Gay:	And these things are getting a couple of times the distance of Pluto from the sun away from this thing in the center of our Milky Way and pretty much the only way we know to shove that much mass into that small of a volume is to create something that looks, smells, tastes like a supermassive black hole.</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	Yeah, totally.</p>
<p>Pamela Gay:	Again, don’t taste the science.  </p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	Don’t taste the supermassive black holes.  So another sort of interesting aspect of the Milky Way is that, you know, is this idea that there is, if you look out beyond the Milky Way, sort of above and below, it really appears like all of the objects around you, all of the galaxies that are in our local area are all kind of sliding towards something.</p>
<p>Pamela Gay:	And this isn’t true if you look in all directions, but if you look in the direction of like the Hydra constellation and the Centaurs constellation, if you look towards that part of the disk of the Milky Way – if you look straight through the disk, all you see is dust, gas, and foreground stars.  The dust and gas of our galaxy, it’s bad.  It likes to block out background light, but if you look directly above and directly below, you’re entirely right.  All of these galaxies seem to have an extra component of their motion that is pointing towards something lined up directly behind the disk of the Milky Way.  </p>
<p>Now, we’re starting to get hints of what that thing looks like as we move into redder and redder wavelengths that are able to pass through that gas and dust, but this thing, this Great Attractor behind the disk was initially detected solely through the motions of galaxies that seemed, well, it looked like there was something calling them their way and we called that thing the Great Attractor.</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	Yeah, and you’re exactly right, that before it was like a big mystery but now thanks to the infrared telescopes, the amount that you can’t see that’s actually blocked by the Milky Way is getting smaller and smaller and you can really start to see that there’s this galaxy cluster that’s just in that area.  So it’s just a galaxy cluster, something freaky.</p>
<p>Pamela Gay:	Yeah, yeah, it’s called the, I’m gonna mispronounce this, it’s the Laniakea Supercluster and it’s tens of thousands of times the mass of our Milky Way.</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	Crazy.  So, there’s a few other things that I think we look at in terms of gravity.  Man, there’s actually just – we could literally do seven shows on this.  You know, we talked about gravity waves, so we can detect moons in orbit around Saturn within the rings because of the way they interact with their gravity with the ring particles and you get these amazing waves and crazy rippley structures in the rings themselves.</p>
<p>Pamela Gay:	And so, in general, any time you have basically a wave going through different fluid media and it turns out that you can treat the rings of Saturn as though they were fluid.  Within different fluid media, the interface between two different fluids, you can end up with different waves being created by the force of gravity between these two fluids and the interactions.  It’s really complicated, ugly math, but the way it looks has actually cropped up in some really neat ways in science fiction novels and what we see is curvy, weird, awesome geometric shapes in the rings of Saturn that are being driven by the gravity from these moons.</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	Yeah, amazing!  These tenders, these moons that tend to the rings.  Just a few more things, think about some of the tidal interactions that we see between galaxies that allows us to chart, like we get to look back through their past by seeing how they look today, especially if they’re totally messed up.  </p>
<p>Pamela Gay:	And this is again, one of those ways that we start to be able to see where is the invisible stuff at the front edge of a collision starting to have an effect.  We will see galaxies that are still clearly fairly far apart, but are already starting to distort one another as you see, well the big gravity from one object that’s only partly visible and invisible having an effect on another object, that again, it’s getting dominated by the dark matter.  </p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	So why don’t we wrap this up, Pamela.  I got one last, final word and this was a press release that was released today when we were recording this, on February 8th.  “On Thursday, scientists will provide an update on the search for gravitational waves.”</p>
<p>Pamela Gay:	Okay, so it is going to be gravitational waves and they’ve now done the press call.  </p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	Yeah, so big thanks to Ellot Avaron for digging that up.  I think we can call it probably gravitational waves detected, but we’ll see what happens on Thursday.</p>
<p>Pamela Gay:	I, you know, how many sigmas could it be?</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	You’re right, you’re right, you’re right.  Gravitational waves not detected.  Gravitational waves ruled out, could be possible too.</p>
<p>Pamela Gay:	No, I’m gonna say it’s gonna be a low sigma detection that they announce that keeps people scratching their heads for a few more months, or years, or decades.  Think about Higgs.</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	Right, that sounds great.  Well, thanks Pamela.  Hopefully we can talk about it next week.</p>
<p>Pamela Gay:	Okay, okay.</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	Thanks, Pamela.</p>

<p>Fraser Cain:	Astronomy Cast episode 401 Future Predictions.  Welcome to Astronomy Cast, our weekly fact-based journey through the cosmos.  We help you understand not only what we know but how we know what we know.  My name is Fraser Cain.  I&#8217;m the publisher of Universe Today and with me is Dr. Pamela Gay, a professor at Southern Illinois University Edwardsville and the director of CosmoQuest.  Hey Pamela, how you doing?</p>
<p>Pamela Gay:	I&#8217;m doing well.  How are you doing, Fraser?</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	Doing great.  So I just wanna let people know that we are switching the way we do the live show of Astronomy Cast.  So we were doing it through Google Plus [Inaudible] [00:00:51] through Google Plus.  We&#8217;re switching to YouTube Live for reasons.</p>
<p>	But the thing that you&#8217;re gonna wanna know is if you haven&#8217;t already, go to YouTube, find the Astronomy Cast channel and subscribe to it.  And then you should get notifications in your telephone or into your email inbox or your Google notification little jobby when we&#8217;ve got new shows happening.  And we&#8217;re gonna be live streaming, which is great because if you&#8217;ve always wanted to catch us live and you always miss it, hopefully you&#8217;ll get a better notification.</p>
<p>	The chat for being able to talk with each other is a lot better.  So that&#8217;s gonna happen for next week.  So if you haven&#8217;t already, go to YouTube, subscribe to Astronomy Cast channel and then kick back and enjoy the space.</p>

<p>Fraser Cain:	Okay.  So last week we updated everyone on what&#8217;s happened since we started Astronomy Cast nine years ago.  So now we&#8217;re gonna look forward and predict the future with hilarious result, what we think will happen in the near and far future.</p>
<p>	So I&#8217;ve put together a bunch of categories, Pamela, and what I thought we would do is that we would just be pundits.  Let&#8217;s just sort of talk about the different topics that I&#8217;ve outlined here and let&#8217;s try and make some predictions on what we think is gonna happen based on trends that are going on about the complexity of the science, about all this kinda stuff.  Are you ready?</p>
<p>Pamela Gay:	I&#8217;m gonna try.  I&#8217;m over caffeinated.  That&#8217;s the best I can hope for, for an episode like this is over-caffeination.</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	Yeah, okay.  Right.  Okay.  So let&#8217;s start with what I think is one of our favorite topics, and this is extra solar planets.  And we made a big deal last week about how much extra solar planets have changed since we started doing Astronomy Cast.  What do we think the future holds for the science of extra solar planets?</p>
<p>Pamela Gay:	I&#8217;m really looking forward to being able to do better spectroscopy of the atmospheres.  And I&#8217;m gonna keep saying this, that within the next ten years I&#8217;m thinking we&#8217;re gonna find that first world that has some atom or molecule that can only exist if there&#8217;s life, hopefully molecular oxygen.  So that&#8217;s the big thing that I&#8217;m looking for.  It may not be in the next 100 episodes but it&#8217;s gonna be the next big thing.</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	Okay.  So hopefully by the time we do, you know, maybe not in the next couple of shows but we should hopefully see some sign of an atmosphere or detecting and analyzing atmospheres will become a lot more commonplace but that there will be just hopefully a discovery of some of these really interesting molecules, the ones that indicate the presence of life.</p>
<p>Pamela Gay:	Exactly.</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	Yeah, okay.  What about finding Earth 2.0?  Do you know what I mean?  The sad part about Kepler, like Kepler was designed to find Earth 2.0 but Kepler had its failure with its not-enough-gyros problem and so it wasn&#8217;t able to turn up Earth 2.0, you know, the earth-size world or [Inaudible] [00:04:46] Star inhabitable zone.  So do you think – when do you think that&#8217;s gonna come around?</p>
<p>Pamela Gay:	That one has me a little bit more perplexed because when you talk about Earth 2.0, I think finding one would be easy if we would just get lucky with the right telescope.  But because right now we&#8217;re gonna have to find it with probably Doppler shifting or one of those other can&#8217;t-look-at-a-million-stars-at-once sort of technologies, it relies on luck.  And when it comes to luck I’m a lot more – I don&#8217;t know what to say.</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	Yeah well, yeah, I mean, it feels to me like – and I&#8217;ve tried to get people to admit it, that the data is in there in the Kepler – </p>
<p>Pamela Gay:	But we don&#8217;t have enough years of data [inaudible] – </p>
<p>[Crosstalk]</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	Well, we don&#8217;t have enough years of data but I&#8217;m guessing there&#8217;s enough kind of hints that using other telescopes and ground-based observatories in other ways, they could try to confirm some of those hints as actual planets.</p>
<p>	So I feel like we&#8217;re gonna see an answer to that.  I was sure we would&#8217;ve seen an answer to this by now.  I&#8217;ll bet you within the next couple of years that we&#8217;re recording this; we will have found that true Earth 2.0, I think.</p>
<p>Pamela Gay:	I&#8217;ll go with your prognostication.</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	And then we&#8217;ve got all the other observatories, right.  We&#8217;ve got Gaia, which isn&#8217;t really specifically designed for that but it can do some planet hunting in a heartbeat.  And then there are other ground-based missions that are doing a really great job of finding worlds.  So what&#8217;s gonna happen when the large Magellan telescope or sort of the overwhelmingly large, extremely large telescope, the next big, the 30 meter telescope gets online, right, things like that?  Although it might not get built thanks – </p>
<p>[Crosstalk]</p>
<p>Pamela Gay:	Well, those aren&#8217;t – the thing with those is they&#8217;re not really designed to do this kind of survey work.  But LSST, it&#8217;s certainly going to be truing them out.  So atmospheric willing, yeah, LSST is probably our next big hope for spitting out planet after planet after planet within the arabars that&#8217;re ground-based prone to dealing with the atmosphere kind of telescope.</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	Okay.  Astrobiology, which is sort of related to this, search for aliens, so what do you think about SETI?  Do you think we&#8217;ll get a signal form SETI soon?</p>
<p>Pamela Gay:	You know, that one I place it very low probability just because of the energy requirements.  And what we&#8217;re finding here on earth is the more advanced our civilization gets, the quieter we get just in terms of reusing lower energy transmission.  We&#8217;re doing more cable-based transmission, fiber optic-based transmission.  So unless they&#8217;re beaming a signal straight toward us, I think that life is gonna be found, again, back to the atmospheric argument.</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	Yeah, I totally agree.  And here&#8217;s sorta the way I think about it is that any alien life form within thousands of light years, any advanced civilization within thousands of light years knows that there&#8217;s life here – </p>
<p>Pamela Gay:	Yeah.</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	 &#8212; and knows – right, and they would&#8217;ve predicted the oxygen like, we&#8217;re going to do it.  They would know that there&#8217;s oxygen on this planet that&#8217;s being produced by life and they would&#8217;ve – 2000 light years away, they&#8217;re looking at us 2000 years ago, they&#8217;re starting to see fires, starting to see wood-burning fires and things like that.</p>
<p>	And so they could almost know what phase of technology and then they could send signals directly at planet earth with the kind of amplitude that they know we would receive.  And so I feel like because we&#8217;re not seeing these signals that we&#8217;re not going to.  That&#8217;s just like my sort of firmy paradox version of that thought process.  So I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;re gonna get a signal from SETI for years.</p>
<p>Pamela Gay:	Yeah, but the kinds of exceptions are like if – I have brought this book up so many times on this show – Mary Doria Russell&#8217;s The Sparrow where they detect an alien civilization because the planet&#8217;s moon is reflecting back radio and they detect the music and the signal.  But that&#8217;s a special – lots of geometry and it&#8217;s fiction, for crying out loud.</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	Yeah, also fiction, yeah.</p>
<p>Pamela Gay:	Yeah, so I [inaudible] [00:09:17] – </p>
<p>[Crosstalk]</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	Yeah, and so I think you&#8217;re right, right.  It&#8217;s like an unintended signal is gonna be really hard to receive.  The only ones we&#8217;re gonna be able to receive are the ones that are blasted right at earth with a really coherent beat.  So that&#8217;s my feel.  Sorry Seth Shostak and the folks at SETI.  That&#8217;s my feeling.  I mean – </p>
<p>Pamela Gay:	Yeah, we still love all the other research you&#8217;re doing.  Keep doing it.</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	Yep, so, okay.  So let&#8217;s talk about the other kind of astrobiology which is finding life in the solar system.</p>
<p>Pamela Gay:	I think it&#8217;s just a matter of figuring out how to sterilize things well enough to go in and look at the places that life is likely to exist.  I can&#8217;t imagine, given the amount of shrapnel that we&#8217;ve sent around the solar system when the earth has gotten hit and the amount of basically cross-pollination of rocks, that we&#8217;re the only world that has life.  And I hate to think we&#8217;re the only place that life evolved to begin with.</p>
<p>	So as we find that Mars has [inaudible]-laced soils with waters, very briny, briny waters but that doesn&#8217;t stop stuff here on earth, as we realize the Titan&#8217;s atmosphere is chemically out of balance, as we look at all of these moons and asteroids and everything else that has water and frozen water and subsurface water, yeah, let&#8217;s start sterilizing things and sending them out.</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	Yeah.  Yeah, I mean, I think the only thing that&#8217;s hampering this is that there just aren&#8217;t a lot of missions that are really purpose built yet to do the search for life.  Someone&#8217;s not making the Martian life finder.  And so – you know what I mean?</p>
<p>Pamela Gay:	Well, so it was actually congressional mandate here in the United States that NASA was not allowed to look for life.</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	I know.</p>
<p>Pamela Gay:	We realized, wait, wait, it might be here.  Well, not here.  We think there&#8217;s life here, we pretend there is but there might be life on Mars, like, for reals, guys.  And so it&#8217;s now become the follow of the water.</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	And so – exactly, and so they&#8217;re doing it sort of half – they&#8217;re sneaking it in, right.  They&#8217;re searching for water or searching for an inch of water but if there are no plans in the works to send the Martian life finder mission which would go with like 14 different experiments to search for life, to sell the atmosphere, to lick the rocks, to take soil and run experiments on it.  And I think that&#8217;s what you&#8217;re gonna wanna send.</p>
<p>Pamela Gay:	And really, only the robots should be licking the science because all the rest of us would just contaminate stuff.</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	Yeah, no, no, only robot tongues tasting the rocks.  But geologists do this so this is not – you&#8217;re a crazy person.</p>
<p>Pamela Gay:	No, I know, I know.  I actually have a sign on my door, do not lick the science.</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	Okay.</p>
<p>Pamela Gay:	But the thing is, there&#8217;s like part of me that keeps hoping, with these close-up zoomy cameras and the ability to bevel in that Curiosity has, that we&#8217;ll find fossilized shrimp or something.</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	Yeah, or like little fossilized, yeah, shrimp or some kind of seashell or – </p>
<p>Pamela Gay:	Yeah.</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	 &#8212; yeah, that would be amazing.</p>
<p>Pamela Gay:	And that&#8217;s probably overzealous wishful thinking but I&#8217;d settle for single-celled mats of something that got nicely fossilized.</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	I think it&#8217;s the most important question we could have answered in sort of planetary science.  And I would love to see a bunch of missions specifically designed to search for it or search the limits of it.  As you said, Titan, let&#8217;s go to Titan, let&#8217;s go to Europa, let&#8217;s go to Enceladus, let&#8217;s go to Mars.  Send a mission its only job is to search for life under every nook and cranny and let&#8217;s find it.</p>
<p>	So I don&#8217;t think – by the time we have this show again, I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;ll have a more definitive answer because there&#8217;s just – I don&#8217;t think the tools have been built yet to get to the answer definitively.</p>
<p>Pamela Gay:	And just to – since this is a pie in the sky, so just to throw an idea out there, imagine that instead of trying to build an entire rover here on earth where every nook and cranny is properly sterilized and this and that and you have to worry about melting things when you&#8217;re radiated, imagine getting to the point where we can 3D print things in a 0G environment so that they never touch anything else.</p>
<p>	And then we take this thing that we built in the vacuum of space without gravity and that&#8217;s what we use to explore so that we have so much more capacity to make sure that stuff is clean .</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	Don&#8217;t worry, aliens, we will have washed our spacecraft&#8217;s hands.</p>
<p>Pamela Gay:	Or just bubble [inaudible] [00:13:54] it.</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	Yeah, exactly.  Okay.  I got so many topics here.  Let&#8217;s talk about human space flight.</p>
<p>Pamela Gay:	Oh, it feels like with human space flight we&#8217;re always three years away from the cool stuff.  And we&#8217;ve been three years away from the cool stuff since we started recording in 2006.  So, I&#8217;ve given up hope and I throw this one back at you.</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	Whoa.  Okay.  Let&#8217;s see, I think that the space station is gonna get a bunch of stays and execution because it&#8217;s very expensive and very cool and they&#8217;re gonna keep funding it, even if the Russians pull out.  They&#8217;ll keep funding it for literally as long as they can keep the thing going.  And ideally they&#8217;ll just keep adding to it.</p>
<p>	I think the Chinese are gonna probably be the first people to set foot on the moon, I think.</p>
<p>Pamela Gay:	I can go with that idea.</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	Yeah, I think that&#8217;s – </p>
<p>Pamela Gay:	I support that.</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	Yeah, I think they&#8217;re gonna be the next people to set foot on the moon.  They&#8217;re getting – they&#8217;ve got manned space stations, they&#8217;ve send Landers to the moon, they&#8217;ve sent missions around the moon to orbit it.  These are all the pieces, making all the pieces – </p>
<p>Pamela Gay:	And they&#8217;re motivated.</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	 &#8212; and they&#8217;re motivated and they got the money to do it.  They literally just don&#8217;t have necessarily the technology yet and all the kinks worked out.  But they&#8217;ve got everything that NASA&#8217;s done to follow in the footsteps, everything the Russians have done and, as you said, the motivation.  And so – </p>
<p>Pamela Gay:	And they&#8217;re so savvy.  They&#8217;ve been sending their best minds to the best universities around the world and then recruiting them heavily to come back.  I can&#8217;t imagine the U.S. recruiting heavily to bring back its expats.  That just doesn&#8217;t happen.  And so they&#8217;re working really hard to get their best minds to come home and to recruit some of the best minds from the rest of the world.</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	Yeah, so that&#8217;s my feeling.  If not, then we&#8217;re looking at the NASA doing potentially its asteroid mission.  But that still feels so pie in the sky.  I mean, you&#8217;ve got the SLS, you&#8217;ve got the Orion, you&#8217;ve got the capability – </p>
<p>Pamela Gay:	I don&#8217;t trust the SLS to actually get completed without getting killed by congress.</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	Oh, well, so I was about to talk about that so let&#8217;s move on.  Oh, before we talk about SLS, let&#8217;s talk about Mars.  Do you think a human will land on Mars when?</p>
<p>Pamela Gay:	2025.</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	2025?  I&#8217;m gonna push it ten years after you, 2035.</p>
<p>Pamela Gay:	I&#8217;m not saying they&#8217;re gonna live.  I&#8217;m saying that some crazy job that gets a hold of a rocket, sends humans that way and they die.  That&#8217;s what I think is going to happen initially and then everything gets put on hold for ten years.  They&#8217;re like, whoa, there&#8217;s radiation.  We need to figure this out.</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	Yeah, I think that – I mean, you look at what&#8217;s happening with SpaceX with Elon Musk and he&#8217;s absolutely committed, and I believe him that he&#8217;s gonna do it.  I don&#8217;t know, it just doesn&#8217;t feel to me like setting human beings down on the surface of Mars to live is as useful as perhaps learning to live better orbitally with rotating space stations, things like that.</p>
<p>	I&#8217;ve just been watching the expanse too much maybe and it&#8217;s really got me pretty stoked on sort of living on every nook and cranny in the whole solar system and not just necessarily the big planets.  But that&#8217;s my feeling so I just think what you said but even more so.</p>
<p>	Let&#8217;s talk a little commercial and private space launches.  So SLS, do you think it&#8217;s gonna – you don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s gonna, in the end, launch?</p>
<p>Pamela Gay:	So SLS is bogged down by the bureaucracy of big government and lots of statutory regulations, whereas SpaceX and these younger companies haven&#8217;t had as many years to develop policies and procedures and paperwork and more paperwork.  And as someone who works for a government university, I understand the difference in nimbleness that just comes from having layers upon layers of paperwork that is generally in existence because someone at some point in the past expletived up.  And so now there&#8217;s a policy.</p>
<p>	Well, if you&#8217;re starting from scratch you don&#8217;t have all of that history.  And you also don&#8217;t have the set in your ways.  And this is something even just you and I have found that as technology changes; you&#8217;ve come to me before and said, &#8220;Well, we need to do this.&#8221;  And I&#8217;m like, &#8220;No, no, no, it&#8217;s too hard, you can&#8217;t do that.&#8221;  And you&#8217;re like, &#8220;But now we have this,&#8221; and like, &#8220;Oh, new technology.  Yes, we can do this.&#8221;</p>
<p>	But if you&#8217;re in a big company you can&#8217;t swing nimbly to take advantage of that stuff.  So I worry that SLS is going to get caught up in bureaucracy and end up with lots of cost overrides and get brutally killed by congress.  And I don&#8217;t see them having the same commercial contracts that you see with SpaceX and Sierra Nevada and [Inaudible] [00:18:46] and these other companies that are attracting commercial partners.</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	Yeah, I think what happens with the Falcon Heavy is gonna really answer a lot of questions.  If the Falcon Heavy launches this year, which it&#8217;s supposed to, and it&#8217;s gonna be pretty much the most powerful rocket system on the earth, and if it starts to integrate the reusable rocket systems, then the SLS is gonna look like a really expensive option for NASA and for everybody.  And if SpaceX can make it dependable and can continue to bring the prices down then it&#8217;s just gonna get harder and harder to justify any other launch system.</p>
<p>	So I just – </p>
<p>Pamela Gay:	Well, and it&#8217;s not just SpaceX is the thing.  We only talk about SpaceX because they&#8217;re the ones that are doing the really awesome failure to consistently land correctly for NASA.  But there are these other companies.  There is Blue Origin, there is Sierra Nevada, there are others whose names never come straight to my mind.</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	Well, I mean, don&#8217;t count out Boeing and – </p>
<p>Pamela Gay:	Yeah, but Boeing is SLS.</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	Well, I understand that but the Boeing has the Deltas and Walking [Inaudible] [00:20:03] – </p>
<p>[Crosstalk]</p>
<p>Pamela Gay:	Yeah, so on the – yeah.</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	 &#8212; and they&#8217;ve got the Atlases.  And right now I think the Atlas is the most powerful launch system on earth and it&#8217;s available [inaudible] five.</p>
<p>[Crosstalk]</p>
<p>Pamela Gay:	Right.  And those are gonna keep going.</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	Yeah, they&#8217;re gonna keep going.  And they&#8217;re watching SpaceX like a hawk.  And they&#8217;re integrating the kinds of changes that they make.  But what they have is they have decades of experience in building these things and running these systems.  So I don&#8217;t think they&#8217;re out of the game either but I think that they brought a whole new track of launch systems.  And it&#8217;s good.  The competition is good.  It&#8217;s good for the people who are gonna be buying these things.  I&#8217;m super excited.</p>
<p>	Okay.  Let&#8217;s move on.  Let&#8217;s talk about stuff here in the solar system.  So what about anything with solar astronomy?</p>
<p>Pamela Gay:	I think we&#8217;re going to continue to refine our understanding of the sun&#8217;s upper atmosphere.  It is still continuing to be highly mysterious.  I think we will continue to see once a year slightly conflicting but slowly moving towards convergence.  While we now understand that Corona has this effect because of this.</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	Right.</p>
<p>Pamela Gay:	I&#8217;m hoping that as we move through another solar cycle we start to – with all of the space imagery we have going on, to finally start to understand if we see this in the imagery it means this is about to occur, being able to predict coronal mass ejections, being able to predict which sunspots will flare out when.  I&#8217;m looking for consistent weather models for the solar atmosphere.</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	Yeah, and I think that&#8217;s one that is really close, as you said.  Astronomers are fairly certain about the way these things work.  Okay.  Let&#8217;s talk about other stuff in the solar system, other planetary astronomy, like will we know what&#8217;s causing those white spots on Ceres.</p>
<p>Pamela Gay:	Oh, we already know that one.  It&#8217;s salt.</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	It&#8217;s salt, okay.</p>
<p>Pamela Gay:	Yeah, sorry, that one we figured out.</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	Okay.  Anything else though?</p>
<p>Pamela Gay:	I&#8217;m looking to find Planet 9.</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	Yeah, that&#8217;d be cool.</p>
<p>Pamela Gay:	Yeah, so let&#8217;s – we need LSST – well, actually I don&#8217;t know if it covers that part of the sky.  We need something to look in all the right places.</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	Does it cover the whole sky?</p>
<p>Pamela Gay:	No, no, because it&#8217;s in the southern hemisphere, so there&#8217;s parts that it can&#8217;t see.  And I don&#8217;t know the predicted where – it has the ecliptic – it can see the ecliptic but I don&#8217;t remember if Planet 9 sticks to the ecliptic.  I don&#8217;t think it does.</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	What about planetary geology?  And I guess we can say hydrology because there&#8217;s so much water out there.</p>
<p>Pamela Gay:	Yeah, we&#8217;re gonna start having sample returns which is gonna start allowing us to hopefully be able to understand the solar nebula that form to the planets a little bit better.  I think that&#8217;s gonna be a whole lot of slow incremental change.  The big thing we need to figure out is how the heck do we keep getting geologic activity on tiny things?</p>
<p>	Ceres had a volcano.  Who would&#8217;ve thunk that?  And Pluto, we – nothing.  What the heck.  So being able to figure out where tectonics comes from when you don&#8217;t have the kind of active squishing that you get around Jupiter and you&#8217;re just free floating things like Ceres and Pluto.</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	In the realm of asteroids I think the search for asteroids is really gonna continue and astronomers will have nailed down the next class of asteroids, right, the smaller ones.  The ones that are potentially threatening to earth down to the city-killer size or it&#8217;ll be down to the 100-meter size.  Like right now we&#8217;re at the one kilometer and above but within the next decade or so we should be down to the 100 meter and above.</p>
<p>Pamela Gay:	Yeah, that&#8217;s LSST&#8217;s job.</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	And other missions that are potentially being put up as well.  So – </p>
<p>Pamela Gay:	Yeah, Gaia will also make major [inaudible] [00:24:13] to that.</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	Yeah, space – what&#8217;s it called, Space Defense, space – anyway it was the one that – </p>
<p>Pamela Gay:	I think that&#8217;s the organization.</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	 &#8212; the B612 Foundation&#8217;s mission, I forget the – Sentinel.  So they&#8217;re planning on putting up Sentinel which is another mission, so there&#8217;s gonna be a bunch of these.  So let&#8217;s talk about some stuff in sort of astrophysics and cosmology.  So black holes.</p>
<p>Pamela Gay:	They&#8217;re there.  They exist.</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	Yeah, okay.  I mean, we&#8217;re going to have the event Horizon Telescope built which is gonna allow us to see the environment around a super massive black hole which is pretty spiffy.</p>
<p>Pamela Gay:	And the kinds of physics that we&#8217;re so close to being able to understand are things like it looks like galaxies are probably spinning at their maximum allowed level but we don&#8217;t have data on very many of them.  So I&#8217;m hoping in the coming years as we&#8217;re able to see with higher and higher resolution the accretion [inaudible] [00:25:15] right down at the event horizon that will be able to do more to understand, well, just how are these suckers rotating?  Because that does reveal itself outside of the event horizon.</p>
<p>	I&#8217;m also hoping that we&#8217;re gonna start to be able to figure out why the heck don&#8217;t we see more binary black holes and galaxies that clearly merged in the past.  And maybe if we&#8217;re lucky catch some that are just on the brink of merging or have just merged and not too close because some things you don&#8217;t want too close.</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	No.  Let&#8217;s hope for an observation of an intermediate mass black hole, which is still a bit of an elusive creature and yet they should be out there.</p>
<p>Pamela Gay:	I don&#8217;t think it has to exist.  I don&#8217;t think we have to have intermediate black holes.</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	That would be weird.</p>
<p>Pamela Gay:	I&#8217;m okay with not finding them.  I am totally okay.</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	Okay.  Well, I mean, that&#8217;s the question, right, do you think – so you don&#8217;t think we&#8217;re gonna find them.  Like if we would&#8217;ve found one – </p>
<p>Pamela Gay:	I think the formation mechanism for super massive black holes is going to be found to be consistently different.  We already know that the most massive galaxies from theoretical models formed all at once possibly mostly in the early universe.  And the smaller galaxies built up through combinations.</p>
<p>	The open question is, did the black holes and the smaller galaxies form in a similar mechanism too and the massive galaxies, were they formed at the same time as the galaxy.  That means that you can have super massive black holes that never went through the stellar mass black hole size scenario.  And this whole myth that we&#8217;ve had of lots of black holes merging and merging and merging, I don&#8217;t think we need that story.</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	Right.  So we&#8217;re at this thought that maybe super massive black holes just form directly.</p>
<p>Pamela Gay:	Yeah, yeah, that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m looking to see.</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	Yeah, yeah, like just a big blob of stuff turned into a super massive black hole and it never was a star.</p>
<p>Pamela Gay:	All the computer models, we need to do all of them.</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	Yeah, yeah.  Gravitational waves, when will we find a direct detection of gravitational waves?</p>
<p>Pamela Gay:	So everyone is making a whole bunch of noise about Lawrence Krauss&#8217;s tweet after he got a text message and how LIGO has everyone set aside for what is it, in February or March.  If that –<br />
=</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	Chatter.</p>
<p>Pamela Gay:	Yeah, if that isn&#8217;t a sick signal or higher detection, I&#8217;m ready to throw in the towel.  I remember back when I was an undergrad in &#8217;95 when they started building the LIGOs.  They were saying we&#8217;re three years away from a detection.  Well, no, it&#8217;s been more than three years guys.  Yeah, we&#8217;ve spent so many billions of dollars on these detectors it&#8217;s really hard to say this just doesn&#8217;t work from the surface of an active planet.</p>
<p>	But my gut, my pessimistic, pessimistic gut is saying we&#8217;re not gonna detect them from the surface of the planet.</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	Wow.  Now, we know they&#8217;re there.  I mean, we&#8217;ve seen them indirectly in the way binary pulsar orbits interact but they haven&#8217;t been detected directly.  And so you&#8217;re thinking that advanced LIGO will probably not provide the level of accuracy that&#8217;s required and that it&#8217;s gonna take something space space like Alyssa.</p>
<p>Pamela Gay:	Yeah, that&#8217;s – again, I&#8217;m being pessimistic on this one – </p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	No, that&#8217;s fine.</p>
<p>Pamela Gay:	 &#8212; but the noise is just far too complicated to get out of the system I think.</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	That&#8217;s super interesting.  Okay.  Partly speaking of physics, let&#8217;s talk about some particle physics.  What kinds of – you know, the Large Hadron Collider turned up the Higgs boson on our watch.  What&#8217;s next do you think?</p>
<p>Pamela Gay:	I&#8217;m hoping that we start to find, not necessarily in the particle colliders but perhaps in the underground tanks, particles that correspond to dark matter.  Just like we&#8217;re detecting nutrena as well, dark matter is probably a particle very similar to nutrenas.  So what I&#8217;m looking for is that next flicker in a tank that says, hey, I&#8217;m dark matter.</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	Yeah, so based on that, I mean, I think the other big hope is that people are gonna see some particles from a super symmetry – </p>
<p>Pamela Gay:	 &#8212; super symmetry.</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	 &#8212; which theoretically should be on the capabilities of the Large Hadron Collider.  Okay.  So let&#8217;s just go to dark matter then.  Do you think we&#8217;re gonna find out what dark matter is?</p>
<p>Pamela Gay:	I&#8217;m hoping?</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	Yeah.</p>
<p>Pamela Gay:	I&#8217;m hoping that we reveal that next tier of particles that come and join the standard model that gives us dark matter.  So the open question is, is it super symmetry or is it just another column that we haven&#8217;t thought about?  And we&#8217;re finding these five-quart close-ons now, yeah.</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	Yeah.  Yeah, I mean, I ask this question to everybody who knows anything about it and it does feel to me like people feel pretty hopeful that the right apparatus is in place now, the right detectors are in place, the right – the VLHC is there to try and actually generate these particles, that all the tools are there now to kinda get to the bottom of this.</p>
<p>Pamela Gay:	We are going to have to crank up the energies more than I think the people who built it are entirely comfortable with, but that&#8217;s always the case.</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	Yeah.  Yeah well, I mean, as always they&#8217;re gonna push that thing to the absolute limits and take it way further than anyone ever expected.  Okay.  Dark energy.</p>
<p>Pamela Gay:	I&#8217;m out.  No idea.  We&#8217;re gonna – </p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	Yeah, and this is the same – I asked the same question.  They were like, dark matter, yeah, I think we&#8217;re pretty close to dark energy and they&#8217;re like, I have no idea.  I have no place to start.  I got nothing.</p>
<p>Pamela Gay:	Yeah, so I think the next big push is to verify that dark energy&#8217;s density has been constant through the age of the universe.  And there&#8217;s some really cool instruments and missions planned, the dark energy explorer down at McDonald Observatory is one of them that will start to get us there.  But they don&#8217;t tell us what dark energy is.  They just tell us where it was and when it was.</p>
<p>	And I honestly am thinking this falls into the category of one of those things that we just need a theoretical genius.  We need that Einstein to come along and give us a new perspective.</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	Yeah, I talked a bit to one to Paul Matsetter and he kinda feels, yeah, like it&#8217;s still way out there, that there is some kinda connection between dark matter and dark energy but it&#8217;s still just all so out there that I&#8217;ll bet you ten years from now we&#8217;ll still be talking about dark energy and we&#8217;re just still gonna be.</p>
<p>Pamela Gay:	Well, it depends if we can [inaudible] [00:32:20] genius or not.  You can&#8217;t predict geniuses.</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	True, yeah.</p>
<p>Pamela Gay:	And this is why we need more diversity in astronomy because we don&#8217;t know where that genius is coming from.  So – </p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	Yeah, it could be you.  Not you – </p>
<p>Pamela Gay:	I know it&#8217;s not me.</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	 &#8212; well, I mean – oh, oh.</p>
<p>Pamela Gay:	It&#8217;s true.</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	I was saying it to the listener but I was also including you, Pamela.</p>
<p>Pamela Gay:	Yeah, I know.</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	Okay.  Let&#8217;s talk about big bang cosmology then.</p>
<p>Pamela Gay:	I’m happy with it.  We&#8217;re gonna continue beating down the arabars at this part.  We going to continue better constraining all of the different variables.  I love the fact that when I started in astronomy, everyone was like, use a Hubble constant of 100 for H not because it just makes the calculations easier and we don&#8217;t know.</p>
<p>	And now it&#8217;s just like we know and we have smaller bars.</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	Seventy-one or whatever it is, yeah.</p>
<p>Pamela Gay:	Yeah, so let&#8217;s just keep going with all those parameters, beating down the arabars and that will make the search for dark energy more accurate.</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	What about inflation?  We were all excited that we found primordial gravitational waves – </p>
<p>Pamela Gay:	 &#8212; that we didn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	 &#8212; to help out with inflation.  Now we&#8217;re back to square one.  Do you think we&#8217;re gonna find evidence for inflation?</p>
<p>Pamela Gay:	Not unless we build another space [inaudible] [00:33:36] I don&#8217;t think we can do it with plank.  I think if we could do it with plank we already could&#8217;ve.  I may simply be pessimistic but that&#8217;s my job on this show.</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	Yep, yeah, you&#8217;re the pessimist, you’re the hardened realist and I&#8217;m the wild-eyed optimist.  Okay.  So, anything else maybe in the Milky Way?  I think one thing that&#8217;s gonna be intriguing is this – you know, we talked about this idea of the alien mega structure which is most certainly not an alien mega structure but it&#8217;s a very weird object, a very strange kind of star that&#8217;s been dimming over a long period of time.  And something is transiting in front of it.  This is a whole new class of object.</p>
<p>Pamela Gay:	I think that we&#8217;re going to continue to realize that solar systems do things we never predicted because we had a sample size of one when we built all of our models for solar systems.  So that one I put out there with anything a science fiction writer could come up with is probably not as crazy as reality.  So, planetary systems will continue to shake the foundations of our lack of understanding.</p>
<p>	But what I&#8217;m really looking forward to – </p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	So vague.  Okay.</p>
<p>Pamela Gay:	 &#8212; what I&#8217;m really looking forward to is – I had the sudden realization last week that graduate students are now starting to factor in being able to use the James Webb Space Telescope while they&#8217;re in graduate school.  And I was like, whoa, we&#8217;re that close that students aren&#8217;t afraid to require it to do their dissertation.  I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s wise.  I don&#8217;t think you should do that.  I&#8217;m a pessimist thought.</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	Totally should do that.</p>
<p>Pamela Gay:	But the thing is with James Webb Space Telescope we&#8217;re going to be able to start doing infrared astronomy that when we partner what&#8217;s possible with all [inaudible] [00:35:24] what&#8217;s possible with James Webb we&#8217;re going to nail the early days of star formation.  So understanding how these molecular clouds collapse, how we get stars turning on, understanding initial mass function, all of these awesome things, where planetary systems do and don&#8217;t form, yeah, we&#8217;re gonna get details on that.  And it&#8217;s awesome.</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	But, you know, we&#8217;re not just talking about the star formation within the Milky Way.  I mean, James Webb will be able to take us right out to the very edge of the observable universe and see – </p>
<p>Pamela Gay:	But it won&#8217;t be able to peer into IF7 [inaudible] universe.  It will be able to tell us when galaxies [inaudible].</p>
<p>[Crosstalk]</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	But it&#8217;s gonna [inaudible], exactly.</p>
<p>Pamela Gay:	That&#8217;s the other side of it.</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	Right.  And so it&#8217;s gonna show us both sort of the near side stars forming and sort of what goes on in those surroundings, but in the far side it&#8217;s gonna let us see right out to the very edge.  The stuff that Hubble has to do, these crazy micro lensing bank shots.  James Webb is just gonna brute force and go, you know, gaze like IF Saron onto all these different objects.  So I’m totally, totally stoked about that.  Anything else, kind of an extra galactic astronomy?</p>
<p>Pamela Gay:	Well, going back to James Webb and Alma, we&#8217;re starting to figure out when stars turned on.  And I&#8217;m hoping we&#8217;ll get the right kind of data to finally be able to say something sensible about how low metallicity stars formed and exploded.  And what point all the types of supernova started to occur so that we can decouple all of the different problems with white dwarfs, having different chemical compositions with possibly different masses.</p>
<p>	There&#8217;s so many different issues with supernovae when we start mucking about with metallicity that we think we know, we think we know.  But with James Webb we&#8217;ll actually know.</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	And this gives us some of the answers to the kinds of questions that we talk about here on Astronomy Cast, right, is like, how long has life potentially been around?  And that&#8217;s been dependent on those heavier elements.  And so the question is, when did those heavier elements really start forming?  That&#8217;ll give us some baseline; some boundaries for answering like the drake equation.  How long has life been around to evolve, to ignore us?</p>
<p>Pamela Gay:	Yeah, when did the stars turn on and when did they die violently and enrich everything around them?</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	And when did you have enough that you could get life, so very cool.  Well, you know, we are out of time so I hope we&#8217;ll pick some time in the future, we&#8217;ll come back around and we will take another look and see if we can make an update on when all the stuff happened.  And then we can go, we were right, we were wrong, we were right.</p>
<p>Pamela Gay:	Exactly.</p>
<p>Fraser Cain:	All right.  Thanks, Pamela.</p>

<p>Fraser: Astronomy Cast, Episode 400, The State of the Universe. Welcome to Astronomy Cast, our weekly facts-based journey through the cosmos. We’ll help you understand not only what we know, but how we know what we know. My name is Fraser Cain, I’m the publisher of the Universe Today. With me is Dr. Pamela Gay, a professor at Southern Illinois University, Edwardsville, and the director of CosmoQuest. Hey, Pam, how you doing?</p>
<p>Pamela: I’m doing well. How are you doing Fraser?</p>
<p>Fraser: Happy 400th episode!</p>
<p>Pamela: Yay! It’s really kind of amazing that we’ve been able to do this and so many people have come along with us for the entire ride and have been there supporting us through messages, through donations, through wearing our T-shirts. That’s actually kind of my favorite thing is to see an Astronomy Cast shirt in the wild.</p>

<p>Fraser: It’s amazing. We started in the fall of 2006, where I wanted – people who don’t know the story, I wanted to start a podcast. You were already doing a podcast. I pitched the podcast to Phil, Phil Plait and he said, “That’s great, but I’m super busy.” But he’s like, “But I know Pamela’s got some time and she’s awesome.” And I’m like, “Who’s this Pamela person?” So I listened to your show, listened to Slacker Astronomy, became a total fan and then Phil was like, “Fraser, Pamela. Pamela, Fraser.” And then we talked and I think within days of having that first conversation we had already recorded our first show. And here we are, seven, eight years later, nine years later, still going strong.</p>
<p>Pamela: Yeah, we talked I think August 18 or so and then we launched our first episode either the last Monday of August or the first Monday of September and have just kept going.</p>
<p>Fraser: Yeah, and it’s great. And, you know, now podcasting is cool, but we’ve been podcasting for a while and we were just waiting for everybody else to catch up, as we do.</p>
<p>Pamela: As we do.</p>
<p>Fraser: And when you think about over time, right, like it started as a very – it was a private audio Skype show that we recorded and we then with [inaudible] [00:03:25] pushed it to being something that we do publicly, where our fans get to hang out with us and we talk to them and answer their questions, which is great. A little stressful, but great. We started CosmoQuest, right?</p>
<p>Pamela: Yeah, yeah, that’s huge.</p>
<p>Fraser: All the stuff that’s happening with Astrosphere, CosmoAcademy, all of that stuff that’s been going on and some highs and lows with that.</p>
<p>Pamela: Sequestration. We survived two government shutdowns, we survived – and for people who don’t realize the scale of what happened, when the sequestration bills hit in 2012 our non-donor funding went down by literally a factor of ten in about four months. And that was brutal. And I’m happy to say that we are going – we have been awarded from NASA funds, there’ll be a full press release coming shortly, but I can safely say, since NASA’s press release is already out, we are going to be not just at pre-sequestration funding, but we are funded to grow and thrive and I will have job postings. So if you want to work for me and live in the middle of the country, yeah, I might just need you.</p>
<p>Fraser: Yeah, and that just shows how seriously NASA and stuff take the kinds of education and outreach and stuff that’s going on via the internet. We knew that what we were doing was of value, but I think a lot of other people thought that the traditional way of reaching out via press releases, via conferences, things like that was the way to perform education and outreach. But we knew the internet was the way and now NASA is dominating the internet, they’re doing a really great job of it. And they really support, now, the stuff that we’re doing. So it’s fantastic. That’s all crazy.</p>
<p>Pamela: And we pioneered with that NSF grant that we had live blogging from conferences back pre-Twitter, there were days before Twitter. That’s shocking. And now conferences are partnering with people to microblog the entire conference and that’s amazing.</p>
<p>Fraser: You had a job as a professor at Edwardsville, still do.</p>
<p>Pamela: I still do, yeah.</p>
<p>Fraser: Still do?</p>
<p>Pamela: I shifted around, you shifted around.</p>
<p>Fraser: I was the publisher of Universe Today and I still am, so again, held the job for a long period of time. I had a three and a five year old when we started, now I have a 12 and a 14-year-old.</p>
<p>Pamela: Now you have a teenager.</p>
<p>Fraser: Yeah, which is crazy.</p>
<p>Pamela: I shouldn’t embarrass Logan, but the first time I met your youngest son he was still periodically wetting the bed.</p>
<p>Fraser: Oh, poor guy. Yeah, and I got remarried. So it’s been – you know. But you still got the same husband so it’s all good.</p>
<p>Pamela: I didn’t have a horse, I had a horse. I had a horse that tried to kill me. I sold that horse, got a different horse that did not try to kill me. Retired him so that he is now the grumpy old horse that chases around the baby horses and doesn’t have to get ridden by me, and am now looking for a horse again.</p>
<p>Fraser: Wow, and the space community I think is one of the things that’s changed the most over these years. It’s just really – it’s everywhere. A lot of the people that we’ve been friends with for a long time have become really successful and it’s just great to see how inclusive…</p>
<p>Pamela: Ian O’Neill.</p>
<p>Fraser: Yeah, Ian at Discovery. [Inaudible] [00:07:09] with Discovery and writing her own books. Brian Koberlein, Phil Plait, obviously dominating Neil deGrasse Tyson who we hung out with at…</p>
<p>Pamela: He was already dominating.</p>
<p>Fraser: He was starting to become popular, but he still – we could hang out with him at a double AS.</p>
<p>Pamela: I think we could still hang out with him.</p>
<p>Fraser: Maybe we still could, yeah. So, yeah, so I think it’s been crazy and here’s to another 400 episodes. And I promise, we won’t make this long until this happens again. So now I’m gonna focus here for a second and I’ll do my official intro. So here we are, 400 episodes after starting Astronomy Cast back in 2006. And in that time we’ve learned a tremendous amount about the universe around us. It’s time to take a second and consider how our knowledge of the universe has changed since we began this show. Now we are going to go all over the place, mostly by our collective excitement. So I think let’s just start with water.</p>
<p>Pamela: It’s everywhere. It is insert expletive everywhere.</p>
<p>Fraser: Yeah, you know, when you think about – I don’t know if you ever read – did you ever read The Case for Mars by Bob Zubrin?</p>
<p>Pamela: No.</p>
<p>Fraser: Okay, so in this book, he’s the one who really sort of pushed forward this idea of living off the land, sending a spacecraft that goes and makes fuel on Mars and then it – and that’s how the astronauts are getting home. And that was the plot of The Martian and things like that. And that’s really NASA’s – the way they’re planning to return to Mars. And in that book he was like, “We don’t know if there’s any water on Mars and so we may need the rocket to take its own hydrogen.” And that once on Mars they’ll then use that hydrogen to make rocket fuel and water for the astronauts and so on. No problem. There’s water on Mars.</p>
<p>Pamela: And what’s amazing is the number of different ways that – we started pre-Phoenix. That little – we are post Spirit and Opportunity, and Opportunity is just gonna keep going forever.</p>
<p>Fraser: Yeah, it’ll bury itself.</p>
<p>Pamela: Outlive us all. But little Phoenix flew, landed, tweeted with fabulous empathy, dug up ice, watched it sublimate and was the start of yes, yes, there is water on Mars. And since then we have identified that the dark streaks are definitely briny liquid and we now have entire regions of thou shalt not pass for Curiosity and Opportunity because we don’t wanna accidentally kill life on Mars.</p>
<p>Fraser: And not only is there water now, but there was water in the past.</p>
<p>Pamela: Exactly.</p>
<p>Fraser: In the ancient past, this was discovered by Spirit and Opportunity just after we – before we started the show. But Curiosity helped turn up that water had been active on the surface of Mars for long periods of time in the ancient past, which is just what you want for potential of life. But Mars is just one place. All of these icy moons, like Enceladus, we’re seeing just so much water on them now under the surface.</p>
<p>Pamela: And Mercury. Little Mercury snuggled up next to the sun, so close that it’s getting atoms blasted off its surface by the incident ions, little Mercury has water.</p>
<p>Fraser: Yep. Vast amounts of water on the moon, both in these craters in eternal sunset and eternal shade, as well as just under the regolith on the moon. And, again, these were all discovered within the last decade.</p>
<p>Pamela: But on the other side of that, we now know that all of the water on Earth probably didn’t come from comets. So the science giveth and the science take us away. We no longer quite know where our water came from.</p>
<p>Fraser: Saturn’s rings. If you’d asked us back when we started Astronomy Cast, “How old are Saturn’s rings?” The question is we don’t know. They could be old, but they also look new. And within the last couple of years astronomers now know that the rings are old, but they look new.</p>
<p>Pamela: Which is one of those kind of tricky things. Now before you start sending the hate letters, we do fully understand that some of those rings are getting refurbished by geysers and things like that, but overall the constant collisional, kinematics dynamics of those rings, this is what builds them up, breaks them down and gives them those nice, shiny, new looking surfaces. And we now are starting to understand that.<br />
Fraser: When we started, was there such a thing as a dwarf planet?</p>
<p>Pamela: It existed as of the week we started.</p>
<p>Fraser: As of the week we started. Okay, well then never mind.</p>
<p>Pamela: Yeah, that was our very first episode.</p>
<p>Fraser: But it wasn’t – I mean, so Pluto became the first, and I think and Ceres at that point were considered the first dwarf planets, but after that a bunch of other dwarf planets were added.</p>
<p>Pamela: And we now understand that Haumea is this really weird spinning thing with a moon that we can’t understand. And in fact, as of just last week, again with the giveth and taketh away, Pluto killer Mike Brown at Cal Tech, one of the far too many Michael Brown’s out there so we’ll just call him Pluto killer.</p>
<p>Fraser: Pluto killer Mike Brown, yeah.</p>
<p>Pamela: Right. So he found all of these interesting things, Eros being the biggest of them at that point, that are now being understood to have weirdly chaotic orbits that aren’t actually chaotic. They seem to be dictated by a high mass object that we’re now calling the new ninth planet.</p>
<p>Fraser: And maybe in 100 episodes we’ll have – it’ll have already been either confirmed or the evidence will mount against it. But speaking of dwarf planets, we saw imagery of Pluto up close from New Horizons, which has gotta be almost my highlight of the entire run that we’ve been doing this show.</p>
<p>Pamela: And maybe in another 100 episodes we’ll understand how the heck we ended up with a brand new surface on Pluto. Pluto should not have a young surface. It’s highly confusing. So give us two years and maybe we’ll have hints, but probably another 400 episodes to actually understand it.</p>
<p>Fraser: I love to ask space scientists, mission planners, “What are you expecting to see when your mission goes to this world?” And the answer that I love to hear them say is, you know, they’ll say like, “We’re looking for the magnetosphere of this and the surface composition of that and the aging of the craters of that.” But the thing they’re really looking for is the big surprises. The stuff that they had no plans for. And with the new imagery of Pluto and Charon, it’s all kinds of surprises.</p>
<p>Pamela: And speaking of spacecraft, we’ve seen Hubble not get decommissioned, but actually get refurbished. And that’s a spacecraft that was originally built under the justification that it would solve the expansion rate of the universe, which it didn’t quite do, we needed Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe. But because of it, it was supposed to figure out planetary nebula and didn’t only help us understand planetary nebula, but it pointed out so many things that we had no clue of. And one of the coolest things that it brought us was the realization that, as you put it as we were prepping for the show, dark matter is stuff and gravity’s not bad. And not bad gravity is how you said it, which was far more cool.</p>
<p>Fraser: What’d I say? Dark matter is stuff and not gravity.</p>
<p>Pamela: Yeah, bad gravity is how you put it.</p>
<p>Fraser: Oh, did I? Right. So this idea, right, that now we’re fairly certain, and by ‘we’ I mean astronomers, are fairly certain that this mysterious dark matter that they clearly see out there, or through its gravitational interaction, clumps, they found whole galaxies that appear to be almost entirely only dark matter. They’ve seen how galaxies can collide with each other and then the dark matter sort of passes right through with the stars, but the dust and gas collects in the middle and starts new star formation.</p>
<p>They’ve really started to understand the scope and scale of dark matter, but they still don’t necessarily even know what it is. So I look forward to that being a thing that we can finally stick a pin in and call that one done. Although, whenever I ask astronomers, the answer that I’m getting these days is, “I think it’s a particle with a very small cross section.”</p>
<p>Pamela: Right. And the fact that we can start to identify the characteristics of the stuff that the dark matter is, we now know it’s not Acme bricks, it’s not white dwarf stars. It’s none of those things that MACHO was looking for. But we are starting to say, “Okay, we need to justify growing up the Large Hadron Collider so that it can do higher energies. We need to expand Fermi National Labs so that it can collide at higher energies. And as we’ve worked on these higher energies, we got to witness, not firsthand, but through the media, the discovery of the Higgs particle and that was really cool.<br />
Fraser: Yeah, I mean, that’s a whole other – that was one of those things – I mean, that’s classic, right? That back in the ‘60s Higgs and team predicted the existence of the Higgs particle, this particle that would provide mass, help explain mass in the universe, and bigger and bigger particle colliders had to get built to the point where it could actually detect this particle. It was only within the last two, three years they finally nailed it down and confirmed existence of the particle, which is just amazing.</p>
<p>Pamela: And it’s been amazing to cover it, from everything from the baguette that broke the world basically, that stupid bird dropping a baguette and breaking everything, to just the – well, if you haven’t watched the movie Particle Fever, go watch it. It explains everything, but it’s been amazing to see from the sidelines the struggle to make some of these discoveries.</p>
<p>Fraser: And then of course, hopefully in the next decade, it will turn up all kinds of new particles and maybe even confirm…</p>
<p>Pamela: Or rule them out.</p>
<p>Fraser: Or rule them out. Or confirm supersymmetry, maybe detect the actual particle that causes dark matter, maybe create microscopic black holes as predicted by Stephen Hawking and see them evaporate. So this journey has only just begun. What else? But, you know, we’ve been talking about all these things that have changed, all this new information that we have, dark energy I would say…</p>
<p>Pamela: We still know nothing.</p>
<p>Fraser: We don’t know anything else. Like, no.</p>
<p>Pamela: We have a noun. We have a noun.</p>
<p>Fraser: I think we mostly are probably are pretty sure that the Big Rip is not gonna happen, probably. But that’s about it. That it doesn’t appear that the expansion of the universe is accelerating – the acceleration of the universe is accelerating, but apart from that, no, we don’t really know what it is. But we do know how old the universe is.</p>
<p>Pamela: And it changed.</p>
<p>Fraser: Yeah, yeah, we thought we knew, but we didn’t know.<br />
Pamela: We knew within error bars it turns out. We now know that we live in a 13.8 billion-year-old universe. [Inaudible] [00:19:46].</p>
<p>Fraser: Yeah, it used to be 13.7 when we started the show.</p>
<p>Pamela: And it turns out WMAP got it mostly right. It had the error bars. I no longer know the error bars, they’re evolving, but we used to say it was 13.7 plus or minus .2 billion years old. We now know it’s 13.8, with smaller error bars that Pamela can’t remember. And, yeah, that’s been cool. And we’ve had lots of mysteries to chase down with the cosmic microwave background because there was the cold spot discovered that we still don’t understand, but there’s been lots of crazy theories.</p>
<p>Fraser: Yeah, crazy theories, like other universes bleeding in, all kinds of stuff. I was gonna mention one thing that we thought we discovered. If we’d done this show a couple years ago we would have thought that in the cosmic microwave background radiation had been discovered evidence for primordial gravitational waves, confirming inflation.</p>
<p>Pamela: But it was wrong.</p>
<p>Fraser: But it was wrong. So what have we learned? We’ve learned that science is hard and that dust inside the Milky Way can maybe cause you to think that you might have seen primordial gravitational waves in the cosmic microwave background. So be careful.</p>
<p>Pamela: Dust and magnetic fields continue to be the two things that are hardest to deal with.</p>
<p>Fraser: So you’re talking about light echoes – sorry, I don’t mean to like – light echoes are our friend.</p>
<p>Pamela: No, it’s cool. So we have discovered that AGNs turn on and turn off, which we knew, but we have now actually seen the evidence of the light echoes turning off. And the MACHO Project has revealed light echoes of supernovae in the past, where we’ve been able to now identify past supernova in our own galaxy that we knew statistically should have happened, but weren’t seen by anyone interested in putting it into the archaeological record. And so we’ve been filling in the history of our own galaxy, one light echo at a time.</p>
<p>Fraser: We’ve watched stuff fall into the super massive black hole, the heart of the Milky Way, stars, gas clouds, maybe, maybe stars.</p>
<p>Pamela: Probably not stars. I’m gonna go with the gas clouds.</p>
<p>Fraser: Maybe. I have it on authority. But still, we’ve watched things of mass get torn apart by the super massive black hole at the heart of the Milky Way and sort of let out a scream as it died. But then for a future state of the universe, we still haven’t actually seen the event horizon of a black hole. There’s a ground telescope in the works, the Event Horizon Observatory, that will help us do that. So that’ll be a future roundup.</p>
<p>Pamela: And just to be clear, you don’t see the event horizon, you see the stuff that is suffering the event horizon.</p>
<p>Fraser: Yeah, the edge of the event horizon, what’s happening right at that environment around the event horizon. But that’s for the future.</p>
<p>Pamela: Science fiction movies would be so much less interesting if event horizons were politely marked so that you couldn’t just kind of wander past them accidentally.</p>
<p>Fraser: Speaking of black holes, we now know that there are super massive black holes at the heart of every galaxy.</p>
<p>Pamela: Yeah, yeah, the only ones that escape are the oddball dwarf spheroidal galaxies, which kind of like don’t match galaxy dynamics but they aren’t globular clusters. So they’re just weird. But ignoring those little dwarf spheroidals of weirdness, yeah, there’s – if you are a galaxy that isn’t a wannabe globular cluster, you have a super massive black hole in you.</p>
<p>Fraser: One of the mysteries that we’ve been hanging on to, still to this day, is which comes first? The black hole or the galaxy around it? And that still, we haven’t got a satisfactory answer to that question. So we’re gonna stop – put a pin in that one and hopefully we’ll have a better answer next time we do this.</p>
<p>Pamela: But we did get a cool answer on, are galaxies built bottom up or top down? And the answer is both.</p>
<p>Fraser: Both, yeah.</p>
<p>Pamela: And that’s cool.<br />
Fraser: Speaking of black holes, we still haven’t found that intermediate mass black hole for certain.</p>
<p>Pamela: Yeah, yeah, how do you get to the super massive? We don’t know. We don’t know.</p>
<p>Fraser: Yeah, but you would think that you would see these – you know, we definitely see the stellar mass black holes, like Cygnus X-1.</p>
<p>Pamela: They’re cool. They’re chilling everywhere.</p>
<p>Fraser: Yep. All over the place. And you would think that those black holes over the billions of years would have accumulated a lot of material, just gotten more and more massive, especially in places like globular clusters, and turned into super massive black holes. But that middle range, there doesn’t seem to be anything in between stellar mass black holes and the super massive black holes. There’s been a few stories, but I don’t think anyone has really out and out confirmed and said, “Okay, that’s it. We’ve definitely found – and we’re finding more of these intermediate black holes.” So that’s another thing that we – I think if you would ask, you know, that would have been something that we would have expected to have been found by now.</p>
<p>Pamela: Yeah, black holes are passive aggressive, not actually aggressive.</p>
<p>Fraser: Right. Man, what else? Okay, so let’s talk about planets. Let’s talk about exoplanets. So when we started the show, we did a couple of episodes, some of the first ones, we did one on just regular exoplanets and then we did one on some weird ones like hot Jupiters and pulsar planets and things like that.</p>
<p>Pamela: But Kepler hadn’t launched yet.</p>
<p>Fraser: And the ground based methodologies for finding planets had not been perfected yet. Yeah, and so here we are now. When we started there was probably dozens of extrasolar planets that had been discovered.</p>
<p>Pamela: And when people talked about finding them, they talked about the Doppler shift method as the primary method of look at a star over and over and over again doing high resolution spectroscopy, lots of difficulty, can only use bright objects because the spectroscopy is hard and you need lots and lots of light to shove it down that slit. But then we started launching things like Crow and Kepler and Gaia is coming. And now the primary way to find them is just watch stars to see if they dim a bit.</p>
<p>Fraser: Yeah, and so we now know of thousands of planets. And the kinds of planets, planets with the mass of the Earth, planets in habitable zone of their parent stars, planets with hot Jupiters and planets in weird eccentric orbits, and binary stars with planets, and quadruple star systems with planets. There’s all kinds of crazy multiple star systems – sorry, multiple planetary systems with sometimes multiple planets in the habitable zone, super Earths, Neptune mass objects. The list just goes on and on and on.</p>
<p>Pamela: Yeah, and what’s weird to think about, though, is while we know so much more about whether or not there’s planets out there, we still know nothing about the probability of alien life, whether it be intelligent, bacterial, or intermediate. All we know is there’s more planets. So I’ve been saying since we launched that any year now we’re going to be able to start measuring atmospheres, which we can do. We started doing that, first half of the sentence was good. Second half of the sentence was, “And we will find the chemical signature indicative of life.” And so far we just haven’t and it’s driving me crazy. This is my…</p>
<p>Fraser: Right. But we are really in the nascent stages. We are to studying atmospheres to what we were to finding planets ten years ago. And so there are plans in the works to build these coronagraphs, these really interesting new kinds of observatories, James Webb, using some of these other space observatories to assist in this process. So I think if we did this show whatever, eight years, nine years from now, ten years from now, we would have a much better conversation about looking at atmospheres. Literally we’re at the yeah, it’s possible to see an atmosphere of another planet on a good day.</p>
<p>Pamela: And we’ve seen a major revolution in technology that is still under way. We saw in 2012, I think it was 2012, ALMA started completely changing how we see things in the longer wavelengths of light. We have Curiosity is a workhorse on one world, but it took a whole mobile lab with us. It’s CSI on the red world. And now we have James Webb Space Telescope getting ready to hopefully start in 2018 and with that…one, two punch of ALMA and James Webb space telescope, we have opened up the early universe and planetary to levels of observation that we just haven’t ever been able to do before.</p>
<p>Fraser: Now, one of the things that I think we would have expected by now was more robust human exploration.</p>
<p>Pamela: Yeah, we got that one wrong.</p>
<p>Fraser: Yeah, we got that one wrong. So I think that we – oh, you know what? Next week we should predict. That’ll be funny. Let’s totally do that. Oh, it’s gonna be fun.</p>
<p>Pamela: Oh, things I hate to do, but yes.</p>
<p>Fraser: Oh, that’d be awesome. So yeah, but I think the stages are coming together so this big revolution has really been the rise of the private space industry. And especially really driven by what’s happening with SpaceX and Blue Origin and with all of these private companies. And that is just – that’s proceeded at a pace that I don’t think anybody expected.</p>
<p>Pamela: But at the same time, I was totally expecting that by now we would see regular launches of Virgin Galactic with space tourists. I was expecting Bigelow to be a little bit further along with their space hotel plans. So we’re in this weird place where it seems that commercial space at the low to high Earth orbit is chugging right along with its plans. And you’re right, it’s the folks – Sierra Nevada, Blue Origin, SpaceX, these companies are doing excellent work hand in hand with NASA in a lot of cases. But when it comes to that suborbital space flight and commercial tourism, it seems like we’re three years away, nine years later.</p>
<p>Fraser: Yeah, and so then also there’s what’s happening with the Chinese. So the whole Chinese space exploration really has happened under our watch with Astronomy Cast, going from launching humans into space, to launching a space station, to sending a Rover to the moon, sending an orbiter around the moon, and very definite plans to put humans on the moon in the near future.</p>
<p>Pamela: And in India, without the human space flight, is making amazing progress as a scientific explorer of space.</p>
<p>Fraser: Yep. And many other countries as well. So India did a great job with the MOM mission, but then there’s other even smaller countries are putting together their own space program. So I think we’re – and Europe, I mean, that’s not like a smaller country, but Europe has been fantastic with the Rosetta, with a lot of really interesting missions. So I think all the countries of the world are really starting to just take this seriously and play a part as well, which is great. It’s great to not just have it be an American story. It’s a worldwide story now.</p>
<p>Pamela: And worldwide stories – we have Russia currently launching all of the humans and also getting attacked from space. So…go ahead.</p>
<p>Fraser: Oh, I was gonna say, yeah, we learned that we are, remember, in a cosmic shooting gallery.</p>
<p>Pamela: Yeah, yeah, and Chelyabinsk was one of those amazing moments of wow, they have a lot of dash cams. And thank science they have so many dash cams. For those of you who don’t remember, on Valentine’s Day in, what, 2012?</p>
<p>Fraser: ’13? ’13.</p>
<p>Pamela: Oh, a lot of stuff has happened over the years. Anyways, the Valentine’s Day massacre occurred. It was still Valentine’s Day here in the U.S., I think it was February 15 in Russia. And during the morning commute, it could not have been better timed, a Apollo class meteorite, asteroid that became a meteorite, encountered the atmosphere, plunged through it, exploded over Chelyabinsk, Russia to be captured by many, many cameras. Generated a giant flash of light that attracted everyone to their windows where they then got attacked by the sonic boom a few moments later.</p>
<p>Fraser: And we now have pieces of this asteroid.</p>
<p>Pamela: We do. We do. It’s – thank you Richard Drumm, you are awesome.</p>
<p>Fraser: Cool. I’m trying to think what else we’ve learned. So a few other things, did you mention Voyager’s left the solar system?</p>
<p>Pamela: I did not, but it has multiple times in fact, if you follow all the press releases. But we think it’s actually left for good this time.</p>
<p>Fraser: For good this time. Astronomers found a ring around an asteroid, which was unexpected.</p>
<p>Pamela: And moons. More moons.</p>
<p>Fraser: More moons around asteroids. And I think we learned that NASA is very complicated.</p>
<p>Pamela: Yes, that’s true. Another great quote from our prep time was Fraser’s like, “Our relationship with NASA is complicated.” And this comes down to watching so many different things both with our own funding and just how you learn to communicate about NASA discoveries from things like there were all the warp drive press releases. And we’ve both had to explain to so many people that NASA funds people to do exploratory research that are sometimes random university professors trying to do awesome things.</p>
<p>And when you see the press release NASA is working on warp drive, sometimes that just means that it’s random dude, you got awesome grant to try something and that doesn’t mean that NASA’s leveraging all of its governmental resources to work on warp drive, because really it’s not. It’s not.</p>
<p>Fraser: So there you go. I think that kind of wraps – I’m sure we could go down this rabbit hole and come up with many, many more, but these are some great examples of the things that have happened over – since we started Astronomy Cast, all of the big new discoveries, all the new things that we know. And it’s been a total honor and a pleasure to sort of do this journey with you, Pamela. It’s been a lot of fun.</p>
<p>Pamela: It really has. And it’s great to work with someone that – yeah, we keep showing up and laughing across basically ten years and we didn’t even meet for the first year and a half.</p>
<p>Fraser: Yeah, totally. So let’s do that. Let’s do that. Next week I’ll cue up a bunch of topics and we’ll make some predictions.</p>
<p>Pamela: That sounds great.</p>
<p>Fraser: We’ll just like just make stuff up. So that’ll be great. And then we’ll see…</p>
<p>Pamela: And this is the only time that Fraser can make up anything he wants and I can’t shoot him down.</p>
<p>Fraser: Absolutely. And then 100 episodes later we’ll look back and see what else is new and see how our predictions held up.</p>
<p>Pamela: And just I also wanna say thank you to all of the people who have donated to keep us going over the years. You have paid Preston through his undergraduate and graduate studies to keep being our editor. You helped in our early days, Rebecca Bemrose-Fetter who was a different student that worked with us. If we get enough donations…</p>
<p>Fraser: Nancy.</p>
<p>Pamela: …I would love to hire another student in the future. There’s been – we’ve gone through a whole series of Nancy’s. We had Nancy Atkinson who worked with us for years, we now have Nancy Graziano who’s helping us out. There’s Suzy. Suzy is our new herder of awesome. We aren’t easy to herd. We need her.</p>
<p>Fraser: Yeah, totally.</p>
<p>Pamela: And a shout out to all of the people at SIUE who have supported us and all of our sponsors. There’s Uncle Bob, who has supported us across multiple of his organizations, Swinburne Astronomy Online has supported us over the years.</p>
<p>Fraser: Casper mattresses have been great, yeah.</p>
<p>Pamela: Casper mattresses. Yeah, we only take sponsorships from things that we believe in and XE.com, so many good people have helped make sure that we can keep going. And here’s to hoping that everyone comes along with us on the same ride for the next 400 years of figuring out…</p>
<p>Fraser: 400 years? Whoa, robot body.</p>
<p>Pamela: Whoa, wrong units, wrong units. Sorry, here’s to hoping that everyone…</p>
<p>Fraser: No, let’s go with your 400 years. That is my – I like to think long term and that’s…</p>
<p>Pamela: You do want to live forever.</p>
<p>Fraser: Yeah, I wanna live forever, so that’d be great. Robot body.</p>
<p>Pamela: So, yeah, let’s keep exploring.</p>
<p>Fraser: All right. Well, we’ll see you next week, Pamela.</p>
<p>Pamela: Sounds great, Fraser. Talk to you later.</p>

Fraser: Astronomy Cast, Episode 400, The State of the Universe. Welcome to Astronomy Cast, our weekly facts-based journey through the cosmos. We’ll help you understand not only what we know, but how we know what we know. My name is Fraser Cain, I’m the publisher of the Universe Today. With me is Dr. Pamela Gay, a professor at Southern Illinois University, Edwardsville, and the director of CosmoQuest. Hey, Pam, how you doing?

Pamela: I’m doing well. How are you doing Fraser?

Fraser: Happy 400th episode!

Pamela: Yay! It’s really kind of amazing that we’ve been able to do this and so many people have come along with us for the entire ride and have been there supporting us through messages, through donations, through wearing our T-shirts. That’s actually kind of my favorite thing is to see an Astronomy Cast shirt in the wild.

Fraser: It’s amazing. We started in the fall of 2006, where I wanted – people who don’t know the story, I wanted to start a podcast. You were already doing a podcast. I pitched the podcast to Phil, Phil Plait and he said, “That’s great, but I’m super busy.” But he’s like, “But I know Pamela’s got some time and she’s awesome.” And I’m like, “Who’s this Pamela person?” So I listened to your show, listened to Slacker Astronomy, became a total fan and then Phil was like, “Fraser, Pamela. Pamela, Fraser.” And then we talked and I think within days of having that first conversation we had already recorded our first show. And here we are, seven, eight years later, nine years later, still going strong.

Pamela: Yeah, we talked I think August 18 or so and then we launched our first episode either the last Monday of August or the first Monday of September and have just kept going.

Fraser: Yeah, and it’s great. And, you know, now podcasting is cool, but we’ve been podcasting for a while and we were just waiting for everybody else to catch up, as we do.

Pamela: As we do.

Fraser: And when you think about over time, right, like it started as a very – it was a private audio Skype show that we recorded and we then with [inaudible] [00:03:25] pushed it to being something that we do publicly, where our fans get to hang out with us and we talk to them and answer their questions, which is great. A little stressful, but great. We started CosmoQuest, right?

Pamela: Yeah, yeah, that’s huge.

Fraser: All the stuff that’s happening with Astrosphere, CosmoAcademy, all of that stuff that’s been going on and some highs and lows with that.

Pamela: Sequestration. We survived two government shutdowns, we survived – and for people who don’t realize the scale of what happened, when the sequestration bills hit in 2012 our non-donor funding went down by literally a factor of ten in about four months. And that was brutal.</itunes:summary>

<p>Fraser:	Astronomy Cast Episode 398, seeing things. Welcome to Astronomy Cast, our weekly facts-based journey through the cosmos, where we help you understand not only what we know, but how we know what we know.  My name is Fraser Cane.  I’m the publisher the universe today.  With me is Dr. Pamela Gay, a professor at Southern Illinois University Edwardsville, and the Director of Cosmo Quest.  Hey Pamela.  How you doing?	Happy New Year!</p>
<p>Pamela:	Happy new years to you.  It’s 2016, and this means that we’ve been doing this show – </p>
<p>Fraser:	forever</p>
<p>Pamela:	for ten years, basically.  So we started September of ’06.  It’s now ’16.  Kinda cool.</p>
<p>Fraser:	There you go.  We were podcasting before it was cool</p>
<p>Pamela:	It’s true.</p>
<p>Fraser:	We were podcasting before it was even acceptable.</p>
<p>Pamela:	Hey, no.</p>
<p>Fraser:	We were podcasting while it was still embarrassing.</p>
<p>Pamela:	Yes, that’s true.  That is entirely true.</p>
<p>Fraser:	Cool.  So we got lots of good shows planned for 2016.</p>
<p>Pamela:	Yes.</p>
<p>Fraser:	All the way through until our summer break.  So hang on, it’s gonna be a fun ride.</p>

<p>Fraser:	Astronomers gather electromagnetic radiation with their telescopes.  Mostly visible light.  But sometimes they gotta be clever about where they look for these illusive photons.  Light can get emitted, absorbed, reflected, and each method tells astronomers a little more about what they’re looking at.  Okay, Pamela, so you put this on the docket.  We’re gonna be talking about different ways that we see the light, and the different journeys that this light takes to make it to our telescopes and eyeballs.</p>
<p>Pamela:	Yes.</p>
<p>Fraser:	So where do you wanna start?</p>
<p>Pamela:	Well, first of all, I wanted to describe why I came up with this crazy topic.  Because this was one of those things that has never appeared on any list we’ve ever had, or been requested by any listener.  But the other day I had a drive-by moment on Twitter, one of these zoom in to look something up on my computer and see this amazing photo on Twitter.  And it was the Twitter equivalent of a driveway moment, where you have to pause to figure out what you’re looking at, like you do sometimes with an NPR story, where you sit in the driveway to figure out what the story’s about. </p>
<p>Fraser:	Yep.</p>
<p>Pamela:	And it was this photo that showed ionized – light emitted through the ionization process by a meteorite going through the atmosphere.  It showed reflected light from a comet, and then it had all the stars and galaxies in the background.  And it was one of these amazing moments of ionization, reflection, and emission, all – </p>
<p>Fraser:	All in the same picture.</p>
<p>Pamela:	And it was this moment of seeing these are the three ways that we’re able to see our universe.</p>
<p>Fraser:	Okay.  And so I guess that’s the part that people maybe didn’t realize before they were getting – listening to this specific show, is that there are these different ways that light – that photons get emitted.</p>
<p>Pamela:	Exactly.</p>
<p>Fraser:	And that we can then absorb, them and each one tells a different story.  So let’s start with the sort of the most common one, the source.</p>
<p>Pamela:	Yes.</p>
<p>Fraser:	Which is the emission.</p>
<p>Pamela:	Exactly.  So when we look at anything that is hot, it’s going to be emitting what’s called black body radiation.  If it’s a stone, a rock, a star, a piece of asphalt, if it’s any of those things that Captain Kirk could light up with his phaser, all of this warm stuff – your hamburger does this if you eat a hamburger for lunch – all of this warm stuff is emitting light in a continuum of colors, an entire rainbow.  And there’s going to be a specific color where it gives off the most of its light that corresponds exactly to the temperature of the object.  As objects get warmer and warmer and warmer, they go from giving off the majority of their light in the infrared – which is what we humans do; we’re little black bodied thermal radiators – to giving off their light in colors that are more like green, which our son does, although our eye perceives the sun as white just due to our inability to perceive green really well.</p>
<p>Fraser:	Well, but also just that it averages out, right?  I mean this is the – </p>
<p>Pamela:	It averages out, yeah.</p>
<p>Fraser:	Right, that we are emitting, or that the sun is emitting photons, and we’re emitting photons, the cosmic background radiation is emitting photons.  There’s photons coming from all these things.</p>
<p>Pamela:	Any warm source, any hot source – and by warm I mean anything greater than, well, absolute zero – everything is emitting photons in this spectrum of colors to a point.  Now the to a point is exceptions like if I look at a compressed sodium lightbulb, I’m going to see stark emission lines from the sodium, because that’s a pure substance that doesn’t have the ability to give off light in every single color.  It doesn’t have thermal emission.  It has emission lines, due to the chemistry involved.</p>
<p>Fraser:	And so when we think about a thing that’s a color, right?  When we think about, you mentioned the sun, but when we think about, I don’t know, a light that is green, or a light that is blue, then we’re seeing blue photons coming off of that object.  We’re actually seeing, as you said, the black bodied radiation, we’re seeing a spectrum of photons coming from that object.  And it’s just where the majority is that’s the color?</p>
<p>Pamela:	It’s how they add up and are perceived by our human eyeballs.  So there are stars out there that give off the majority of their light in the ultraviolet, because they’re extremely hot, bright stars.  But our eyes don’t see those colors. But what we see is all the colors that are, well, visible in the colors our eyes can see.  So we perceive these stars as bright, bright blue.  At the same time, there are stars that have peak radiation out in the infrared, which again, our eyes can’t see.  So we’ll perceive them as a deep, deep red, because they’re still giving off a lot of light in that tail of the block body spectrum that’s in the visible red.  </p>
<p>So that’s hot things that are giving off thermal emission where it’s everything bouncing around and emitting every possible color of photon.  Then, like I said, there’s also that emission lines that come from specific atoms going, “And now I shall let my electrons jump from this level to this level.”  And when that happens, a photon is emitted for emission lines, or there’s also cases where they’re absorbed out, which we don’t see with our eyeballs, which is an absorption spectrum.</p>
<p>Fraser:	So can you talk about that emission, those specific emissions?  So if we take a, I don’t know, if we take a rock, and we heat it up.</p>
<p>Pamela:	That’s thermal emission.</p>
<p>Fraser:	Thermal emission.  Right.</p>
<p>Pamela:	Yes.</p>
<p>Fraser:	But in this case, it’s giving off photons that are in the infrared.  They are getting emitted and they are sort of across the range.</p>
<p>Pamela:	Exactly.</p>
<p>Fraser:	They are literally just different wavelengths.  Some are a shorter wavelength, some are longer wavelength, and we perceive the warmth from the rock with the eyeballs that are our hands that we feel the temperature coming off of the rock.  And it’s an average temperature, and that is sort of, again, this is kind of like the average of all of those photons getting emitted.  But you said that you can have situations where photons will get emitted in a very specific line, emission line.  So what’s going on there?</p>
<p>Pamela:	So here we have a different kind of situation.  With the thermal emission, it’s everything bouncing around, and that kinetic energy, lots of complex physics, you end up with a continuum of photons coming off.  If you have a single element or a cloud of specific elements, for instance inside of a fluorescent light tube, inside of that compact sodium bulb.  If you then look at that specific chemical mixture using a pair of those rainbow glasses you can get in novelty stores, you’ll see the light get spread out into specific lines of color.  And different lines will be different brightnesses.  </p>
<p>So if you go and look at a bright red open sign, a neon sign that’s actually probably filled with hydrogen, you’ll see a really bright red line, and some other fainter lines.  And what’s happening is you have the electrons.  Well, that red line comes from an electron falling from being excited up to the third energy level in hydrogen and dropping down to the second energy level in hydrogen. And when the electron changes energy levels, it gives off a discrete photon that has a very specific energy that is a shade of red.  When an electron goes between two other levels, two to one, that’s going to be a different color.  And in that case, it’s a color we can’t see with our eyes.</p>
<p>Fraser:	And this is very useful for astronomers.</p>
<p>Pamela:	Yes.  Yes.  So for instance, if I’m looking at hydrogen at any place in the universe, I know that those hydrogen spectral lines, that three to two energy jump that gives off a photon, that two to one energy jump that gives off a photon, wherever I look in the universe, the photons are emitted at the same color.  But if that object’s moving relative to me, perhaps getting carried away by the expansion of our universe, that color is going to get shifted toward the red if it’s moving away, toward the blue if it’s coming towards us via its own volition – that’s not going to happen with most galaxies.   And I can measure that velocity, that Doppler shift, by looking to see how these known colors get shifted redward and blueward. </p>
<p>Fraser:	And so in this case, right, astronomers have a very specific filter that they can put on to their telescope to only filter that very specific wavelength into their CCD, into their cameras, right?</p>
<p>Pamela:	So we do that when we’re looking at things within our own galaxy, where we know that the relative velocities aren’t that great.  We’ll throw what’s called an H alpha, a hydrogen alpha filter, for that three to two energy jump, and this allows us to focus in on the hydrogen in local nebulas.  The hydrogen in local star-forming regions, and see them detailed. We also might do this if we’re looking at the sun, in which case we also use a lot of neutral density filters to bring down the amount of light we’re looking at.  </p>
<p>But when we’re looking beyond our own galaxy where things can get shifted to radically different wavelengths, there are times that we use custom built filters to look for things at very specific wavelengths.  But most often what we’ll do is look at an object through a spectrograph, through a device that’s designed to spread the light out into a rainbow by either putting it through a slit or reflecting it off of what’s called a grism.  </p>
<p>Through all of these different techniques, sometimes using prisms and slits in combination, using all of these different techniques to create this rainbow, we can zoom in and say, “I don’t know how fast this object is moving.  I don’t know what atoms are in it.  But I’m going to look, and I’m going to identify these fingerprints of atomic spectral lines based on their spacing and say now, by looking at how this fingerprint is shifted redward or blueward, I can get the velocity of this unknown object.</p>
<p>Fraser:	Okay, so that was the first part of your, I guess, of that comet meteor star image that you were talking about, and that’s the emissions.  And that’s sort of this great fingerprint for seeing what speeds that galaxies are moving away from us, or towards us, even some of the chemical constituents of some of those galaxies.  Which ones are having more star forming regions, things like that.  So let’s go for the second one, then.  Let’s talk about the ionization that you saw in that image.</p>
<p>Pamela:	So this is where an object decides to make its reality known by heating up the stuff around it until the stuff around it gives off light.  So, for instance, if we have just a grain of sand colliding with the earth’s atmosphere, and plunging down through that atmosphere, which is what happened during meteor storms, which some of you might have seen with the geminids in December.  </p>
<p>When these particles plunge down through our atmosphere, they have a lot of kinetic energy that they lose to the atmosphere as they frictionally interact, they lose their velocity.  The energy ends up getting transmitted to all of the particles around them.  And one way of looking at energy is temperature.  And when that transferred energy hits the equivalent of about 10,000 degrees, that will cause the hydrogen to ionize.  Different chemicals ionize at different temperatures.  At the end of the day, when we see that blue green streak through the sky, what we’re seeing is the oxygen, the nitrogen, all of the different atoms that make up, and molecules that make up our atmosphere are getting hit with so much ionizing energy that they give off light. </p>
<p>Fraser:	So the meteor, as it’s passing through the atmosphere, is heating up the atmosphere.  This heat is then going in to these atoms in the atmosphere, and when they hit a certain point, they’re then giving off more photons.</p>
<p>Pamela:	They’re just flat out giving out photons.  A normal, everyday nitrogen atom is just hanging out going, “Hi!  I’m nitrogen.”  That molecular oxygen in our atmosphere, it’s just sitting there being quiet, blocking light.  </p>
<p>Fraser:	Very stable.  Yeah.  Very stable.  Happy to hold onto its photons</p>
<p>Pamela:	Well, happy to hold on to its electrons. </p>
<p>Fraser:	Right.</p>
<p>Pamela:	And as that meteor streak by going, “Hi!  Here, have my kinetic energy.”</p>
<p>Fraser:	“Enjoy.”</p>
<p>Pamela:	Exactly.  Those electrons are no longer so happy to stay in their energy levels, and they cascade to higher energy levels, and then drop back down.  And it’s in that drop back down that they give off all of this light that we see.</p>
<p>Fraser:	And so, again, what does this tell astronomers?</p>
<p>Pamela:	Well, it first of all tells us, hey, there’s something high energy right there.  There’s a meteor passing through the atmosphere.  And, based on what colors we see, we can start to see what is at different levels in our atmosphere that’s getting excited.  </p>
<p>One of my favorite examples of this interaction with our atmosphere is the Aurora Borealis, which occurs when high energy particles cascade along magnetic field lines in the earth’s atmosphere, give up their energy to the surrounding particles, and we end up with these amazing light shows.  And depending on what color we’re seeing, that’s different altitudes in our atmosphere that are getting excited.  That’s different molecules that are getting excited.  So we can see, based on the colors of the aurora, how deep into the atmosphere the particles are plunging.</p>
<p>Fraser:	So just to sort of discuss that situation, right, so you’ve got these high energy particles coming from the sun.  They’re moving with a tremendous amount of velocity.  The earth’s magnetic field sort of pulls them, directs them – </p>
<p>Pamela:	Yes.</p>
<p>Fraser:	as they interact through, directs them down into the atmosphere, and same thing as the meteors, they are giving off energy into the surrounding atoms, and those atoms are then having the electrons rise and drop in energy levels, and that is generating photons that we then see as this ionized radiation in the sky.</p>
<p>Pamela:	Exactly.</p>
<p>Fraser:	The colors, right, we get these blues and these greens.  Is there a correlation between the – what’s causing those colors to be the colors that we see?</p>
<p>Pamela:	Different colors are actually coming from different atoms and molecules in our atmosphere.  So when you see different colors, you’re seeing different parts of our atmosphere, quite likely at different altitudes, getting excited.  And we did an entire show on this a while back, so go ahead and look up that show, and it talks about specifically what color corresponds to what atom.</p>
<p>Fraser:	Okay.  So we’ve got emission.  We’ve got ionization.  And the last one, I think, is reflection.</p>
<p>Pamela:	Exactly.  And reflection is how we understood pretty much everything we knew about our own solar system other than the sun up until about 50 years ago.  Everything we knew about other worlds came from either sunlight reflecting off of them, or from our own attempts to bounce radar beams off of things, which is another way of reflecting light.  So when we look at Jupiter in optical colors, or in infrared colors, the light that we’re seeing is largely reflected sunlight.  When we look at Mars, it’s largely reflected sunlight.  </p>
<p>Now the reason I say largely is these are large, warm bodies, and Jupiter, in particular, gives off excess energy, because it is generating thermal energy just by being a large collapsed ball of gas that’s getting crunched by gravity.  Mars has still not fully cooled off, and is a warm object.  But the majority of the light we see, especially in the optical and the infrared, isn’t that, “Hi!  I’m warm” light.  It’s instead reflected sunlight.  And it’s kind of weird to think about if our sun shut off, suddenly we’d be blind to all of these objects.  </p>
<p>And this actually led people to start thinking about, well, is it possible that dark matter is nothing more than planets that are so small and so far from their stars that they are, as they run loose through the universe, creating the appearance of there being dark matter?  Don Winget, one of my faculty at the University of Texas many, many  moons ago, made the comment that you could explain dark matter fairly well by roughly one acme brick-sized chunk per solar system-sized volume of space in the universe.  </p>
<p>Now that assumes even distribution, you have to adjust the distribution of Acme bricks to get at our actual distribution of dark matter.  Programs like the Macho project looked really hard for these small blobs of undetected planet masses and didn’t find them.  So between the Macho project and our own detection of things via gravitational microlensing over the years, it’s becoming more and more clear that Acme bricks don’t explain dark matter.  But there still are, certainly, planets out there that are, via various matters ripped from their stars that we will never see because they’re failing to reflect light in a meaningful way.</p>
<p>Fraser:	And so the objects in the solar system are just one example of the kinds of things that you can see with reflection.  You can also see nebulae, right?</p>
<p>Pamela:	You can see nebulae through reflected light.  Anytime you’re seeing a blue nebulae, that’s actually what’s called a reflection nebulae because the light is moving perpendicular through your line of sight, through the cloud, and then getting reflected off of particles and scattered back towards us here on earth.  When you see a red nebulae, that is where the light, just like with the sunset, the blue has been scattered away, and the red makes it through straight to your eyes.  So, with the red, that’s transmission.  But when you see the blue, that’s reflected light.</p>
<p>Fraser:	One of my sorts of favorite ideas in this sort of world is light echoes.  And I think we did a whole show on light echoes.  But just this idea that you can actually see this expanding sphere of reflection around objects, stars and things inside a nebulae, just blows my brain.</p>
<p>Pamela:	And one of my favorite discoveries from the Macho project had nothing to do with what they were planning to do with the Macho project.  But as they observed the areas around the large, I believe it was large Magellanic cloud, year after year after year, they were able to see these, what they thought initially we optical defects, these bands of light through their images, appear to move over time.  And as the bands moved, it became clear these were not internal reflections.  These were not defects in the images.  These were echoes of long past supernova.  So what happened at the dawn of civilization is still echoing through our universe, and what happened at the dawn of our planet is also still echoing, but a lot harder to detect, because those echoes are much more spread out.</p>
<p>Fraser:	Yeah.  And so if you miss the supernova on the first time, as it goes off, and you miss the light directly, the light is gonna escape through the surrounding nebulae, or the surrounding material that maybe the star had sluffed off years before, and that you can get other shots, other chances at seeing this light bounce back as it passes through these layers of material.  It’s a fascinating concept.  So, I mean, that’s another example.  Are there any other examples, maybe, that astronomers will use reflection to study something?</p>
<p>Pamela:	Well, one of my favorite examples of this builds on the concept of light echoes, and it’s V838 Mon.  This is a very strange, strange star that had a couple of flares back in, I believe, the detection was in late 2002.  It maybe have been early 2003. And these flares reflected off all of the gas and dust that surrounds this star, which is in a fairly dense pocket.  And as the light continued to radiate and bounce off of more and more complex parts of the dust and gas around the star, we saw this evolving picture of clouds being illuminated one after another.  And we learned about the structure around the star.  We were able to detail how the color evolution of the flares took place by looking to see, okay, so this part is this color, this part is this color.  </p>
<p>It gave us so much information about both the star’s flare event and the intervening matter.  And then it was just plain weird.  And anytime you can have something weird and unexpected and beautiful with the thing that you’re looking at forcing you to define news ways to define our universe, that’s kind of awesome.  And this was one of those awesome things.  And it happened to be a variable star.  So I’m a fan.</p>
<p>Fraser:	And there’s lots of other examples, really kinda cool tricks that astronomers have done with light.  Like ways to study the reflectivity of earth by looking at how the light from the sun is reflecting off the earth and then onto the moon.  </p>
<p>Pamela:	Yes.</p>
<p>Fraser:	And you can measure the earth’s shine on the moon.  And then you can use that method in theory to search for extrasolar moons, to study extrasolar planets, all of these tricks that we’re practicing here in our solar system, will then have versions of that that are gonna be useful for studying whole other solar systems.</p>
<p>Pamela:	And at the end of the day, the only way we can see the faint, tiny Kuiper belt objects that haven’t been visited by a certain little tiny mission called New Horizons is to look at them in reflected light.  And we can guess at their compositions based on how much light they do and don’t reflect.  Their albedo, is the fancy word for this.  And highly reflective objects, we guess at being icier.  Less reflective objects, we guess at being, well, a little less icy, a little more sooty or covered in carbon stuff.  We have to guess at this information based on well how things reflect light.</p>
<p>Fraser:	Very cool.  Anything else on – or should we wrap this episode up?  We’ve talked about the three ways that we see the light.  </p>
<p>Pamela:	I think we’re good.  And I’d encourage everyone to go out and force yourself out of bed when the weather says it’s going to be clear, and take a look at the Catalina comet that’s up right now.  And maybe you, too, can catch that moment of a shooting star, a comet reflecting light, and all of the beautiful stars in the background.</p>
<p>Fraser:	Yeah.  It’s very close to Arctururs right now, I think.</p>
<p>Pamela:	So easy to find.</p>
<p>Fraser:	Easy to find.</p>
<p>Pamela:	And lots of information.  Just give it a Google.</p>
<p>Fraser:	All right.  Thanks Pamela.</p>

Fraser:	Astronomy Cast Episode 398, seeing things. Welcome to Astronomy Cast, our weekly facts-based journey through the cosmos, where we help you understand not only what we know, but how we know what we know.  My name is Fraser Cane.  I’m the publisher the universe today.  With me is Dr. Pamela Gay, a professor at Southern Illinois University Edwardsville, and the Director of Cosmo Quest.  Hey Pamela.  How you doing?	Happy New Year!

Pamela:	Happy new years to you.  It’s 2016, and this means that we’ve been doing this show – 

Fraser:	forever

Pamela:	for ten years, basically.  So we started September of ’06.  It’s now ’16.  Kinda cool.

Fraser:	There you go.  We were podcasting before it was cool

Pamela:	It’s true.

Fraser:	We were podcasting before it was even acceptable.

Pamela:	Hey, no.

Fraser:	We were podcasting while it was still embarrassing.

Pamela:	Yes, that’s true.  That is entirely true.

Fraser:	Cool.  So we got lots of good shows planned for 2016.

Pamela:	Yes.

Fraser:	All the way through until our summer break.  So hang on, it’s gonna be a fun ride.

Fraser:	Astronomers gather electromagnetic radiation with their telescopes.  Mostly visible light.  But sometimes they gotta be clever about where they look for these illusive photons.  Light can get emitted, absorbed, reflected, and each method tells astronomers a little more about what they’re looking at.  Okay, Pamela, so you put this on the docket.  We’re gonna be talking about different ways that we see the light, and the different journeys that this light takes to make it to our telescopes and eyeballs.

Pamela:	Yes.

Fraser:	So where do you wanna start?

Pamela:	Well, first of all, I wanted to describe why I came up with this crazy topic.  Because this was one of those things that has never appeared on any list we’ve ever had, or been requested by any listener.  But the other day I had a drive-by moment on Twitter, one of these zoom in to look something up on my computer and see this amazing photo on Twitter.  And it was the Twitter equivalent of a driveway moment, where you have to pause to figure out what you’re looking at, like you do sometimes with an NPR story, where you sit in the driveway to figure out what the story’s about. 

Fraser:	Yep.

Pamela:	And it was this photo that showed ionized – light emitted through the ionization process by a meteorite going through the atmosphere.  It showed reflected light from a comet, and then it had all the stars and galaxies in the background.  And it was one of these amazing moments of ionization, reflection, and emission,</itunes:summary>

<p>Fraser:	Astronomy Cast Episode 397, why is there something and not nothing?  Welcome to Astronomy Cast, our weekly facts-based journey through the cosmos, where we help you understand not only what we know, but how we know what we know.  My name is Fraser Cane.  I’m the publisher of the universe today.  With me is Dr. Pamela Gay, a professor at Southern Illinois University Edwardsville, and the Director of Cosmo Quest.  Hey Pamela.  How you doing?	</p>
<p>Pamela:	I’m doing well.  How are you doing?</p>
<p>Fraser:	Great.  As we are speaking right now, it is the height of the geminid meteor shower.  We had beautiful, clear skies last night, and a couple of friends got a chance to see some.  As soon as this show is over, I am gonna, because we’re recording in the evening, unusually, I’m gonna go out and try to catch some on Monday.  Although it’s also bitterly cold here in Canada, so I’m gonna see how long I can last outside as I look for geminids. But the geminids are at their greatest, at their peak, which people don’t realize now.  The geminids are really one of the biggest meteor showers that we can get.</p>
<p>Pamela:	I was actually born during the geminid meteors, and somehow that has explained so many different things.</p>
<p>Fraser:	Yeah, your birthday was yesterday?</p>
<p>Pamela:	Saturday.</p>
<p>Fraser:	Saturday.  Right, okay.  Yeah.  Okay.  Well let’s get on with the show.</p>
<p>Female Speaker:	This episode of Astronomy Cast is brought to you by 8th Light Inc.  8th Light is an agile software development company.

<p>Astronomy Cast is proudly sponsored by Cleancoders.com.  Training videos with personality for software professionals.</p>
<p>Fraser:	So one of the biggest most basic questions you can ask is why is there something and not nothing?  And the reality is that we don’t know the answer.  We might never know the answer.  But let’s probe to the edge of what we can explain, and what ideas cosmologists have proposed to explain how we all got here.  All right, Pamela.  This is a special holiday gift to me that you’re willing to entertain my wild flights of fancy and talk about a topic that normally you wouldn’t touch with a ten foot pole.</p>
<p>Pamela:	Exactly.</p>
<p>Fraser:	So I deeply appreciate you playing ball. And this is like my favorite question to ask to stump cosmologists and stump scientists.  Because, obviously the answer is we don’t know, but what I love is how they explain we don’t know.  So before we kinda get into this, let’s get right to the limit, and sort of – let’s talk about the big bang theory itself, and where it ends.  If that makes sense.</p>
<p>Pamela:	Okay.  Yes.  So the big bang theory basically explains that our entire universe originated 13.8 billion years ago, and it arose out of a single point.  Now, as the theories go currently, the single point underwent rapid inflation, and within the first three minutes, pretty much everything we have in the universe went from a point of pure energy where all the forces were tangled together, to the forces breaking apart, to particles falling out of the energy to a burst of nuclear synthesis that got us helium, a touch of lithium, a bit of beryllium, and, of course, we had hydrogen.  </p>
<p>And then the universe basically expanded and cooled, and expanded and cooled, and expanded and cooled until somewhere between 300 and 400 thousand years after the big bang, at which point the universe had expanded and cooled enough that atoms were finally able to form out of this malaise of colliding particles.  And when this happened, the electrons glommed on to all of the completely ionized nuclei that were flying about, and we ended up with a neutral universe that was dense and dark and the release of the microwave background radiation.</p>
<p>Fraser:	And there are multiple lines of evidence.  We’ve done a whole show about this.  I’ve done a video about this.  There are multiple lines of evidence, each of which confirms that the universe is currently expanding, that everything in the universe is expanding away from each other, that if you run the clock backward, you get to that 13.8 billion years that you mentioned.  So the big bang really wonderfully explains sort of that everything is moving away from each other, that it was once a singular point.  That’s all great.  But it falls apart, obviously, or fall apart isn’t the right term, right?  It’s that it fails to explain what set off the whole process in the first place.  </p>
<p>Pamela:	Right. So we’re in a situation where, for the best of our understanding, we can say that everything went down to a point. Now the question that we get left with was this part of a wave function collapse where the point wasn’t a point that then stopped at the point, but rather was just sort passing through as things went flying, or as wave functions changed.  We run into problems of we observationally can’t see anything from before the formation of the cosmic microwave background, so is it even valid to discuss what came before the big bang when we can’t even see what happened before the C and B.  </p>
<p>And then you run into problems like how do you try and understand all of this within the context of the arrow of time, this fact that there’s so many things in our universe that require time to be a constant step in a single direction.  For instance, well there’s a lot of movies of pool balls colliding, that if you ran them forward or backwards, you’d never be able to tell the difference.  There are a lot of situations that the science only runs in one direction.  For instance, if you throw a water balloon at someone.  That’s a video you can tell instantly whether or not you’re watching it in reverse, because once that balloons pops, that water and plastic isn’t spontaneously going to recombine to recreate that water balloon.  </p>
<p>How do we explain a universe that appears to be always be marching in one direction?  It’s very uncomfortable to think about did it come out of an infinite past and go into an infinite future in this constantly line?  It seems like it should somehow circle back on itself, but you can’t do that if time only marches in one direction.   And so people are trying to figure out how do we uncouple all of these different problems.  And then there’s the most fundamental problem at all, which is once you’re within the smallest fraction of a second, and once you’re within plank time, suddenly you have to be able to unify a general utility in quantum mechanics in order to have a coherent conversation.  And those two things don’t work and play well with one another.</p>
<p>Fraser:	So, I mean, our instinct is to sort of imagine, as you said, time marching forward, event after event, unfolding one after the other.</p>
<p>Pamela:	Right.</p>
<p>Fraser:	But with the universe, as we currently understand it, not only was the whole universe sort of down to this initial singularity, but time itself began with the beginning of the expansion of the universe.  And so, you know, it’s bordering on a nonsense question to ask what came before time, right?  What is more north than north is one of the problems.  But I think you’ve got at least a little bit of a stepping stone there, right, which is what you mentioned is that we can’t even still explain how gravity and the sort of grand unified strong force – </p>
<p>Pamela:	There is no grand unified theory.</p>
<p>Fraser:	Right.  There is no grand unified theory that includes gravity.  And so it’s like the last rung on the ladder to that singularity still hasn’t yet been figured out.  So there’s still hope to push the boundary at least a little bit more forward.</p>
<p>Pamela:	Right.  And it’s a hope that some of us are starting to feel less and less sure is actually gonna hold out.  And it’s possible that either gravity simply doesn’t have a string theory or a particle physics or a standard model way of being discussed that makes sense within our current paradigm, and it may be generations before someone who’s able to create that fundamentally new paradigm comes along.  So there’s that challenge of we need to give birth to a new paradigm changer.  Then there’s the problem of are we getting stuck by our own closed-mindedness.  </p>
<p>A lot of people are constantly going down the same road of string theory, which is admittedly the only direction where new ideas have been generated for a while.  But, there’s no evidence for string theory whatsoever.  So the big theory that people are trying to figure out if they can work on is the idea that the big bang comes out of the collision of string theory membranes, or just branes is what they usually call them.  </p>
<p>And the math actually works out with this theory that it’s sort of like three dimensional sheets of paper floating through a many-dimensional space, sort of like a two-dimensional sheet of paper blowing in the wind in our three dimensional space.  And when two of these branes collide, they end up generating a stable new space in which we could maybe, possibly exist, but we don’t know.  And so that’s one theory that’s being worked on.</p>
<p>Fraser:	Right.  And if I sort of understand that when you get these potential collisions between these membranes, which is probably not anything like what they are if this is correct.  We imagine these sort of membranes, because our puny meat brains can only imagine this kind of thing.  But that you sort of get the – we actually talked about this just a couple of episodes – the frustrating fact for most physicists that a lot of the pieces of the universe are these constants.  This is how strong gravity is.  This is how strong alpha is.  This is how strong the weak force is.  And that all of those sort of fell out as – they got hard coded into the universe when this interaction happened.  So, that’s sort of one implication from string theory.  But that’s just one possible idea.  Right?</p>
<p>Pamela:	That tangles it slightly.  So we’re looking at a couple of different things.  So the theory that I’m talking about is one that came from Paul Steinhardt and Neil Turok. And I started this work back in 1999 at a cosmology forum where they were both having this moment of how do we work ourselves out of this hole that the big bang has dug us into with the beginning of the universe?  And with the collision of branes, what you actually can end up with an oscillating universe system.  </p>
<p>So you have this multiverse, and with the multiverse you can have different physical parameters tumbling out of different colliding branes and out of different oscillations.  But side by side with that you also have Andrei Lynde’s idea of infinite inflations where you have inflation once it’s gets going.  You might end up with parts of it that just keep bubbling off, and each of these different bubbling bits and pieces is its own universe with its own physical constant.  So there’s multiple ways to get to multiverses.</p>
<p>Fraser:	And so what you’re saying with that other sort of multiple inflations, then, is that there is some other universe, and then, I guess, things inflated to the point that it almost like it branched off and began its own timeline with its own constants –</p>
<p>Pamela:	Exactly</p>
<p>Fraser:	that we then experience in.  So time began for us in this universe, but maybe there was time previously in previous – in whatever was the universe that we branched out of.</p>
<p>Pamela:	Or even a more interesting idea, and this is one that’s been getting worked on by Sean Carroll a lot, is that in this bubbling froth of bubbles, perhaps in our universe time is going in one direction, and in another universe time is going in another direction.  And because there’s no particular favored direction for time, not that it can go sideways, but it sometimes feels like it goes sideways.  But anyways, since you can have some universes with time going forwards, and some with time going backwards, you get closer to the North Pole as the farthest north you can go, but you can still keep walking.  And so you don’t have that infinite beginning problem.</p>
<p>Fraser:	One of the really interesting calculations that I’d seen Sean Carroll had done was this idea of sort of quantum fluctuations, that you can – the air in this room is most likely according, the probability is that the air in this room is gonna remain in this room.  But there’s a really super remote chance that all of the air could suddenly rush up to one tiny little corner of the room, and I could suffocate.  But most likely that’s not going to happen.  </p>
<p>But then you sort of take that idea of quantum mechanics further, you could imagine sort of virtual particles appearing out of nowhere, and you can sort of take that to this idea that you could have, they talk about x, this idea that eventually, if you run the numbers long enough that actual particles and eventually even completely conscious minds could appear, which then would collapse other wave forms.  That’s sort of, you know.  But he even ran the numbers all the way to what it would take for an entirely new big bang to form.  And the fact is that if the universe is – the universe might be infinite in size, and so if it is infinite in size, then if you run the numbers long enough, this is gonna happen.  And not only that, it’s gonna happen an infinite number of times, that random luck is gonna organize all of the particles into another big bang.  </p>
<p>But for sure, or it definitely appears that the universe is gonna be infinite in time.  And so if we just wait long enough – I forget what it was, 10 to the power of 50 to the power of 50 to the power of 50 or something just ridiculous; a number that is so big it is beyond all comprehension – that you’ll get another big bang.  That all of the particles of the universe will form themselves into a big bang, and then begin the expansion there.  That they will all collapse down into this momentary point.  And so with fairly reasonable theories that physicists have seen – this idea of quantum mechanics, virtual particles popping in and out of existence – that you could just do the math to come up with a situation where you get all that, which is kind of amazing.</p>
<p>Pamela:	And one of the cool phrases that I ran across while prepping for this show was all you need to generate a universe is an empty vacuum and a shard of dark energy.  And the idea is that wherever you have vacuum and energy, particles are going to spontaneously come into existence.  And more to the point, bubbles of the universe are going to spontaneously come into existence.  And each of those bubbles, most of them will just burst instantly, like soap bubbles.  But occasionally you get just the right combination that they grow and grow and grow into something stable that is capable of rather than bursting, well, supporting entire civilizations.</p>
<p>Fraser:	And yet, the question that you have to ask yourself is where did that come from, right?  That how could you get an empty vacuum and a sliver of dark energy, right?  That that one thing is a question that has to come from somewhere.  So one interesting book, or lecture that I’ve seen – I haven’t read his book yet – this is Lawrence Krauss – he does this great calculation.  And he calls his book A Universe from Nothing.  </p>
<p>And the gist is that if you add up all of the positives and all of the negatives of the universe, right? So if you add up all of the matter, and if e equals mc squared, and you balance that against the dark energy, and you balance that against the dark matter, and you balance that against the potential gravity, right, the potential energy from the gravity, the mutual gravity of all those objects, you write this great big accounting of it, and you total it up at the bottom, you get zero.  That all the positives and all the negatives in the universe, in the end, balance out to zero.  </p>
<p>Which is the only reasonable answer you could get.  Anything else would be quite baffling, if you ended up with a little bit more positive than negative in the universe, or a little bit more negative than positive in the universe.  But the fact that it actually all balances out to zero is very reassuring.  Right?</p>
<p>Pamela:	So I have to admit, I didn’t even know that book existed.  But what I found, which was actually a really excellent read, is Stephen Hawkings, on his website, which is hawking.org.uk, has a lecture that he gave on the origin of the universe.  And it goes through and it talks about a lot of the stumbles that we’ve made, a lot of the attempts that people have gone down in terms of trying to understand.  He’s the one who I ruthlessly stole the analogy of you can go all the way north, but you can still keep walking, which is where you start to get into a different version of circular time.  So I strongly recommend going and checking out Hawking’s lecture.  It’s also kinda neat to read because he wrote it to be read by a speech synthesizer, so there’s some really funky grammar – not grammar, really funky punctuation in there.  It’s just there just to make sure his speech synthesizer sounds rational.  </p>
<p>Fraser:	Right.  So what kinds of ev – as a physicist, as an astronomer, you’re always looking for evidence.  So what are some kinds of evidence that maybe, that cosmologists and stuff are looking for that would try to give some kind of indication about which direction it is?  What would be very intriguing?</p>
<p>Pamela:	Well, so as always, people are always searching the cosmic microwave background, because that is where all evidence of all cosmological everything at the end of the day needs to appear.  And people have been looking for small symmetries.  They’ve been looking for echoes where things are the same in two directions.  They’ve been looking for all manner of statistical fluctuations or lack of fluctuations that will support each of these different theories.  Now, at the end of the day, so far the cosmic microwave background has remained mute on the matter.  And we keep hoping the next instrument, the next instrument, the next instrument.  So if COBE to WMAP, now to PLAY, we keep hoping.</p>
<p>Fraser:	Can you explain that a little more deeply?  You said an echo.  What would that look like?</p>
<p>Pamela:	So for instance, if we live in a somewhat small, finite universe, you will legitimately about to see the same light coming from two different directions as the light goes around, essentially, the four dimensional hypertoroid that is, quite possibly, our universe.  And so as the light loops around from one point to our point, it’s coming at us from two sides.  </p>
<p>Fraser:	Right, okay.  So it would be like living in a mirror box, and you would look to the left and you see your reflection of what’s on the right.  And so you know that that tells you a little bit about the scale of the universe, and potentially, maybe what could be influencing it from the outside, if there even such a concept, right?</p>
<p>Pamela:	So we also do look for particular hints that might lead us to say this is where our universe is colliding with another one.  This is where we’re seeing echoes from different branes.  There is a particularly cold spot in the cosmic microwave background that people have been baffled by, and periodically cosmologists pop up with theories of how it might be explained by the influence of a different universe outside of our own.  But then another cosmologist always comes along and goes thump, no.  So that is still a debate that isn’t solved.</p>
<p>Fraser:	What about gravity?  One of the ideas, I know, is that gravity is weaker than the other forces, and this is one of the, potentially, the implications from some of the theories on this, and that maybe that’s somehow leaking from other universes or from whatever, right?</p>
<p>Pamela:	Right.  Or other dimensions is usually what people talk about.  Is since our universe is three observable dimensions plus time, and with string theory, and pretty much all theories trying to explain the aspects of different particles, you end up having to invoke additional dimensions, the number of additional dimensions depending on which particular theory.  I haven’t, for a while, seen a reputable theory that had less than 11 dimensions.  So they’re getting up there in number, and gravity, it’s thought, might be part of those other dimensions where it’s stronger.  </p>
<p>And I would like to mention trying to understand all of these different things is part of what leads us to such weird notation like we talked about last week.  I got an email from one of my faculty at the University of Texas, Bill Jeffries, who pointed out that one of the reasons that we use the term spin, even though you can’t look at an electron and say that sucker is spinning in one direction or another.  Not valid thinking.  Do not associate the idea of spin with it spinning like a top.  But the reason we use is the mathematics that get used to explain how particles with different spins interact and work and function, it all requires us to take into account equations that look and act just like angular momentum.  So there’s lots of stuff going on, and lots of people are trying to figure out how all of this ties together with a multidimensional theory.</p>
<p>Fraser:	So and then I guess the other question is that maybe there can be some kind of echo.  I mean, we talked about the cosmic microwave background radiation, but maybe there’s some kind of echo in the actual vacuum of space itself, the actual structure of space could somehow point us towards what might have come before.</p>
<p>Pamela:	And we have been able to start determining certain characteristics about what happened prior to the formation of the cosmic microwave background by looking at what are called the sound waves in the cosmic microwave background.  If you look at the statistical fluctuations with the hot spots and the cold spots, and how many there are of this size, and how many there are of that size, you get this structure of there’s this many in this band, this many in this band.  </p>
<p>As we’re trying to figure out how to explain within the context of particle physics all of these different aspects that we can see and measure of particles – we don’t see them spinning actually, but we see something that is what induces the Pauli exclusion principle.  And that something acts like angular momentum.  We see magnetic moments.  We see all of these different attributes. Color is, again, we just made that one up.  But we see all these different attributes, and people are trying to use them multidimensional theories.  </p>
<p>And in trying to understand our universe, with three observable dimensions plus time, we need to try and understand all of these things that are outside of our observable universe in a lot of ways.  And it gets challenging and multiverses, where you can simply say there is a universe in which everything is possible just somehow alleviates all of that pain, because what we may not be able to explain except as fine tuning or something precisely made in just the right way, suddenly just becomes oh!, the universe rolled a Yahtzee, and a different universe didn’t roll a Yahtzee.</p>
<p>Fraser:	Of course if the universe didn’t roll the Yahtzee, we wouldn’t be here to observe the dice.  What of the other things that – you’ve mentioned this a little bit, and I think we should probably do a whole episode on this at some point – is this unsettling idea that the universe is one collapse away, one sort of energy drop away from total collapse.  And maybe that is the way the universe ends, and then perhaps the way the next one begins, right?</p>
<p>Pamela:	Its’s the whole idea that nothing likes to stay in an excited state.  And we know that our universe isn’t in, essentially, a ground state energy.  We are, essentially, in an excited state.  So what happens when the universe decides it wants to, well, become less enthusiastic about existence and drops down to a lower energy, and we go poof.</p>
<p>Fraser:	Right.  Yeah, I think we’re gonna do a whole episode of that at some point.  Yeah, which will be great.  But I think we’ve sort of reached the end of this, so that’s it.  Thank you so much, Pamela, for entertaining me, and allowing me to throw this topic on the slate.  And yet we tried to keep it in the science. For the person who – I wanna sort of give people sort of one final piece of ammunition, which is when a person says, “Well, the big bang can’t explain where it all came from, therefore big bang is stupid.”  How do you respond to them on that?</p>
<p>Pamela:	I say we can’t always understand everything, and this is why we do science.  And there’s lots of things that it’s just gonna take time to understand, and this is why we keep looking, and keep looking up, and keep doing the maths.  And theories that we have right now, the basic big bang theory, it explains so many observables that have no other explanation.  So we’re just one step away, or maybe a few hundred, to study science.  </p>
<p>Fraser:	Yeah.  And the mystery is worth it, so let’s keep looking. </p>
<p>Pamela:	And one final note, we are not going to be back before Christmas because I’m gonna be on an airplane back from a business trip next Monday.  But I’m gonna remind you now that we have shirts, like the one I’m wearing right now, that says Astronomy Cast on it.  These are available at astrogear.spreadshirt.com.

Fraser:	Astronomy Cast Episode 397, why is there something and not nothing?  Welcome to Astronomy Cast, our weekly facts-based journey through the cosmos, where we help you understand not only what we know, but how we know what we know.  My name is Fraser Cane.  I’m the publisher of the universe today.  With me is Dr. Pamela Gay, a professor at Southern Illinois University Edwardsville, and the Director of Cosmo Quest.  Hey Pamela.  How you doing?	

Pamela:	I’m doing well.  How are you doing?

Fraser:	Great.  As we are speaking right now, it is the height of the geminid meteor shower.  We had beautiful, clear skies last night, and a couple of friends got a chance to see some.  As soon as this show is over, I am gonna, because we’re recording in the evening, unusually, I’m gonna go out and try to catch some on Monday.  Although it’s also bitterly cold here in Canada, so I’m gonna see how long I can last outside as I look for geminids. But the geminids are at their greatest, at their peak, which people don’t realize now.  The geminids are really one of the biggest meteor showers that we can get.

Pamela:	I was actually born during the geminid meteors, and somehow that has explained so many different things.

Fraser:	Yeah, your birthday was yesterday?

Pamela:	Saturday.

Fraser:	Saturday.  Right, okay.  Yeah.  Okay.  Well let’s get on with the show.

Fraser:	So one of the biggest most basic questions you can ask is why is there something and not nothing?  And the reality is that we don’t know the answer.  We might never know the answer.  But let’s probe to the edge of what we can explain, and what ideas cosmologists have proposed to explain how we all got here.  All right, Pamela.  This is a special holiday gift to me that you’re willing to entertain my wild flights of fancy and talk about a topic that normally you wouldn’t touch with a ten foot pole.

Pamela:	Exactly.

Fraser:	So I deeply appreciate you playing ball. And this is like my favorite question to ask to stump cosmologists and stump scientists.  Because, obviously the answer is we don’t know, but what I love is how they explain we don’t know.  So before we kinda get into this, let’s get right to the limit, and sort of – let’s talk about the big bang theory itself, and where it ends.  If that makes sense.

Pamela:	Okay.  Yes.  So the big bang theory basically explains that our entire universe originated 13.8 billion years ago, and it arose out of a single point.  Now, as the theories go currently, the single point underwent rapid inflation, and within the first three minutes,</itunes:summary>
